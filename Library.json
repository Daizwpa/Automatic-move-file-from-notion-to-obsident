  {"id":"abbadurrehmanPerformanceAnalysisMachine2021","abstract":"Thyroid disease arises from an anomalous growth of thyroid tissue at the verge of the thyroid gland. Thyroid disorderliness normally ensues when this gland releases abnormal amounts of hormones where hypothyroidism (inactive thyroid gland) and hyperthyroidism (hyperactive thyroid gland) are the two main types of thyroid disorder. This study proposes the use of efficient classifiers by using machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and other performance evaluation metrics to detect and diagnose thyroid disease. This research presents an extensive analysis of different classifiers which are K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, decision tree and logistic regression implemented with or without feature selection techniques. Thyroid data were taken from DHQ Teaching Hospital, Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan. Thyroid dataset was unique and different from other existing studies because it included three additional features which were pulse rate, body mass index and blood pressure. Experiment was based on three iterations; the first iteration of the experiment did not employ feature selection while the second and third were with L1-, L2-based feature selection technique. Evaluation and analysis of the experiment have been done which consisted of many factors such as accuracy, precision and receiver operating curve with area under curve. The result indicated that classifiers which involved L1-based feature selection achieved an overall higher accuracy (Naive Bayes 100%, logistic regression 100% and KNN 97.84%) compared to without feature selection and L2-based feature selection technique.","author":[{"family":"Abbad Ur Rehman","given":"Hafiz"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Chyi Yeu"},{"family":"Mushtaq","given":"Zohaib"},{"family":"Su","given":"Shun Feng"}],"citation-key":"abbadurrehmanPerformanceAnalysisMachine2021","container-title":"Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering","DOI":"10.1007/s13369-020-05206-x","ISSN":"21914281","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,1]]},"page":"9437-9449","publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","title":"Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Thyroid Disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"abdelgawadBmodeUltrasoundColor2020","abstract":"Background: Enlarged cervical lymph nodes are the most commonly encountered neck lumps. Ultrasonography is the most extensively used tool for classification of superficial lymph nodes due to its availability and low cost. Ultrasound (US) elastography refers to a non-invasive imaging technique that can describe tissue displacement (i.e., strain) or stiffness in response to a given force. The aim of this study is to compare between B-mode sonography, color Doppler, and sonoelastography in assessment of enlarged deep cervical lymph nodes. Results: The prevalence of benign lymph nodes was 26 out of 84 (31%). Lymphomatous lymph nodes were 22/84 (26.2%), while metastatic lymph nodes were 36/84 (42.8%). Color Doppler evaluation of nodal vascular pattern was of high sensitivity (91.7%), specificity (80.8%), and accuracy (88.6%) for differentiating metastatic and benign nodes (P value was < 0.001). There was a significant difference between elasticity scores of benign and malignant lymph nodes (P < 0.001). The most frequent score in the malignant group was 3 (21/27) (77.8%) while the most frequent score in the benign group was 2 (5/11) (45.5%). The mean strain ratio (strain index) for malignant lymph nodes (mean 3.2 ± 0.8) was significantly greater than that for benign lymph nodes (mean 1.1 ± 0.8). Conclusion: Ultrasound elastography with its high sensitivity and specificity is a helpful improvement in US for the assessment of cervical lymph nodes, in which biopsies should be performed.","author":[{"family":"Abdelgawad","given":"Ehab Ali"},{"family":"Abu-samra","given":"Manal F."},{"family":"Abdelhay","given":"Nasr Mohammed"},{"family":"Abdel-Azeem","given":"Hoda Mokhtar"}],"citation-key":"abdelgawadBmodeUltrasoundColor2020","container-title":"Egyptian Journal of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine","DOI":"10.1186/s43055-020-00273-4","ISSN":"20904762","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"publisher":"Springer","title":"B-mode ultrasound, color Doppler, and sonoelastography in differentiation between benign and malignant cervical lymph nodes with special emphasis on sonoelastography","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"abdikenovAnalyticsHeterogeneousBreast2019","abstract":"Breast cancer prognostic modeling is difficult since it is governed by many diverse factors. Given the low median survival and large scale breast cancer data, which comes from high throughput technology, the accurate and reliable prognosis of breast cancer is becoming increasingly difficult. While accurate and timely prognosis may save many patients from going through painful and expensive treatments, it may also help oncologists in managing the disease more efficiently and effectively. Data analytics augmented by machine-learning algorithms have been proposed in past for breast cancer prognosis; and however, most of these could not perform well owing to the heterogeneous nature of available data and model interpretability related issues. A robust prognostic modeling approach is proposed here whereby a Pareto optimal set of deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibiting equally good performance metrics is obtained. The set of DNNs is initialized and their hyperparameters are optimized using the evolutionary algorithm, NSGAIII. The final DNN model is selected from the Pareto optimal set of many DNNs using a fuzzy inferencing approach. Contrary to using DNNs as the black box, the proposed scheme allows understanding how various performance metrics (such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1, and so on) change with changes in hyper-parameters. This enhanced interpretability can be further used to improve or modify the behavior of DNNs. The heterogeneous breast cancer database requires preprocessing for better interpretation of categorical variables in order to improve prognosis from classifiers. Furthermore, we propose to use a neural network-based entity-embedding method for categorical features with high cardinality. This approach can provide a vector representation of categorical features in multidimensional space with enhanced interpretability. It is shown with evidence that DNNs optimized using evolutionary algorithms exhibit improved performance over other classifiers mentioned in this paper.","author":[{"family":"Abdikenov","given":"Beibit"},{"family":"Iklassov","given":"Zangir"},{"family":"Sharipov","given":"Askhat"},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Shahid"},{"family":"Jamwal","given":"Prashant K."}],"citation-key":"abdikenovAnalyticsHeterogeneousBreast2019","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2897078","ISSN":"21693536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"18050-18060","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","title":"Analytics of Heterogeneous Breast Cancer Data Using Neuroevolution","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

In this paper, we focus on the challenging problem of nodule detection from ultrasound scans. In current clinical practice, this task is performed manually, which is tedious, subjective and highly depends on the clinical experience of radiologists. We propose a novel deep neural network architecture with carefully designed loss function regularization, and network hyperparameters to perform nodule detection without complex post-processing refinement steps. The local training and validation datasets consist of 2461 and 820 ultrasound frames acquired from 60 and 20 patients with a high degree of variability, respectively. The core of the proposed method is a deep learning framework based on multi-task model Mask R-CNN. We have developed a loss function with regularization that prioritizes detection over segmentation. Validation was conducted for 821 ultrasound frames from 20 patients. The proposed model can detect various types of thyroid nodules. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method is effective in thyroid nodule detection. Comparisons with the results by Faster R-CNN and conventional Mask R-CNN demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the prior state-of-the-art detection methods.","author":[{"family":"Abdolali","given":"Fatemeh"},{"family":"Kapur","given":"Jeevesh"},{"family":"Jaremko","given":"Jacob L."},{"family":"Noga","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Hareendranathan","given":"Abhilash R."},{"family":"Punithakumar","given":"Kumaradevan"}],"citation-key":"abdolaliAutomatedThyroidNodule2020","container-title":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103871","ISSN":"18790534","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"PMID":"32658741","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Automated thyroid nodule detection from ultrasound imaging using deep convolutional neural networks","type":"article-journal","volume":"122"},

The BRAF <sup>V600E</sup> gene encodes a protein-dependent kinase (PDK), which is a key component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and essential for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. The BRAF <sup>V600E</sup> mutation causes PDK to be activated improperly and continuously, resulting in abnormal proliferation and differentiation in PTC. Based on elastography ultrasound (US) radiomic features, this study seeks to create and validate six distinct machine learning algorithms to predict BRAF <sup>V6OOE</sup> mutation in PTC patients prior to surgery. This study employed routine US strain elastography image data from 138 PTC patients. The patients were separated into two groups: those who did not have the BRAF <sup>V600E</sup> mutation (n = 75) and those who did have the mutation (n = 63). The patients were randomly assigned to one of two data sets: training (70%), or validation (30%). From strain elastography US images, a total of 479 radiomic features were retrieved. Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with stratified tenfold cross-validation were used to decrease the features. Based on selected radiomic features, six machine learning algorithms including support vector machine with the linear kernel (SVM_L), support vector machine with radial basis function kernel (SVM_RBF), logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were compared to predict the possibility of BRAF <sup>V600E</sup> . The accuracy (ACC), the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPEC), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves of the machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate their performance. ① The machine learning algorithms' diagnostic performance depended on 27 radiomic features. ② AUCs for NB, KNN, LDA, LR, SVM_L, and SVM_RBF were 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65–0.91), 0.87 (95% CI 0.73–0.95), 0.91(95% CI 0.79–0.98), 0.92 (95% CI 0.80–0.98), 0.93 (95% CI 0.80–0.98), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.88–1.00), respectively. ③ There was a significant difference in echogenicity,vertical and horizontal diameter ratios, and elasticity between PTC patients with BRAF <sup>V600E</sup> and PTC patients without BRAF <sup>V600E</sup> .

Methods: 18F-FDG PET/CT images between March 2010 and September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed in patients with focal 18F-FDG uptake in the thyroid gland and who underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy from this area. The focal uptake in the thyroid gland was drawn in 3D with 40% SUVmax threshold. Features were extracted from volume of interest (VOI) using the LIFEx package. The features obtained were compared in benign and malignant groups, and statistically significant variables were evaluated by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. The correlation between the variables with area under curve (AUC) value over 0.7 was examined; variables with correlation coefficient less than 0.6 were evaluated with machine learning algorithms. Results: Sixty patients (70% train set, 30% test set) were included in the study. In univariate analysis, a statistically significant difference was observed in 6 conventional parameters, 5 first-, and 16 second-order features between benign and malignant groups in train set (p < 0.05). The feature with the highest benign-malignant discriminating power was GLRLMRLNU (AUC:0.827). AUC value of SUVmax was calculated as 0.758. GLRLMRLNU and SUVmax were evaluated to build a model to predict the exact pathology outcome. Random forest algorithm showed the best accuracy and AUC (78.6% and 0.849, respectively).

We tested the association of BRAF V600E mutation with papillary thyroid carcinoma at King Hussein Cancer Center. Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed PTC who underwent surgical treatment between 2006 and 2015 were included in this study. Oncological outcomes, both short-and long-termed, were collected. Results: A total of 128 patients (68% females) were included in this study with a mean age of 38 years (±13.8). The median follow-up period was 50 months. The BRAF V600E mutation was found in 71% of patients. The tumour size for patients with a negative BRAF V600E mutation was significantly larger in comparison to patients who tested positive for the mutation (3.47 cm vs 2.31 cm, respectively, P = 0.009). The two groups showed similar disease-free survival (DFS) rates; positive = 75% (median 43 months (0–168)) compared to 78% for the negative BRAF V600E mutation (median 38 months (3–142)) (P = 0.162, HR = 0.731) Furthermore, both groups showed similar overall survival rates, positive = 94.5% (median 56 months (0–228)) compared to 94.6% for the negative BRAF V600E mutation (median 43 months (3–157)) (P = 0.941, HR = 0.940). Conclusion: BRAF V600E mutation had no effect on loco-regional recurrence, distant metastasis, overall survival, or DFS.

Although expert knowledge is reliable for annotating regions informative of malignancy and other known histologic patterns (strong supervision), it is unreliable for identifying regions informative of mutational status. This poses a serious impediment to obtaining higher prognostic accuracy and discovering new knowledge of pathobiology. We used a weakly supervised learning technique to train a DNN to predict <italic>BRAF</italic> V600E mutational status, determined using DNA testing, in H&amp;E‐stained images of thyroid cancer tissue without regional annotations. Our discovery cohort was a tissue microarray of only 85 patients from a single hospital. On a large independent external cohort of 444 patients from other hospitals, the trained model gave an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97–1.00), which is much higher than the previously reported results for detecting any mutation using H&amp;E by DNNs trained using strong supervision. We also developed a visualization technique that can automatically highlight regions the DNN found most informative for predicting mutational status. Our visualization is spatially granular and highly specific in highlighting strong negative and positive regions and moves us toward explainable artificial intelligence.

However, based solely on these features noted by the pathologist, a logistic regression classifier gave an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 in five‐fold cross‐validation, which is much lower than that obtained using the DNN.

Tumor cells stimulate significant molecular, cellular and physical changes within their host tissues to support tumor growth and progression. An emerging tumor microenvironment is a complex and continuously evolving entity. The composition of the tumor microenvironment varies between tumor types, but hallmark features include immune cells, stromal cells, blood vessels, and extracellular matrix. It is believed that the “tumor microenvironment is not just a silent bystander, but rather an active promoter of cancer progression” (Truffi et al., 2020). Early in tumor growth, a dynamic and reciprocal relationship develops between cancer cells and components of the tumor microenvironment that supports cancer cell survival, local invasion and metastatic dissemination. To overcome a hypoxic and acidic microenvironment, the tumor microenvironment coordinates a program that promotes angiogenesis to restore oxygen and nutrient supply and remove metabolic waste. Tumors become infiltrated with diverse adaptive and innate immune cells that can perform both pro- and anti- tumorigenic functions (Figure 1).

Methods: Two hundred and ten patients who met the selection criteria were enrolled in the study and subjected to ultrasound-guided FNA of thyroid nodules. Different radiomics features were extracted from sonographic images, including intensity, shape, and texture feature sets. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), and Random Forests/Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost) algorithms were used for feature selection and classification of the univariate and multivariate modeling, respectively. Evaluation of models performed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: In the univariate analysis, Gray Level Run Length Matrix - Run-Length Non-Uniformity (GLRLM-RLNU) and gray-level zone length matrix - Run-Length Non-Uniformity (GLZLM-GLNU) (both with an AUC of 0.67) were top-performing for predicting nodules malignancy. In the multivariate analysis of the training dataset, the AUC of all combinations of feature selection algorithms and classifiers was 0.99, and the highest sensitivity was for XGBoost classifier and MRMR feature selection algorithms (0.99). Finally, the test dataset was used to evaluate our model in which XGBoost classifier with MRMR and LASSO feature selection algorithms had the highest performance (AUC = 0.95).

  {"id":"arefanPredictingCellInvasion2021","abstract":"Background: The abundance of immune and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is informative of levels of inflammation, angiogenesis, and desmoplasia. Radiomics, an approach of extracting quantitative features from radiological imaging to characterize diseases, have been shown to predict molecular classification, cancer recurrence risk, and many other disease outcomes. However, the ability of radiomics methods to predict the abundance of various cell types in the TME remains unclear. In this study, we employed a radio-genomics approach and machine learning models to predict the infiltration of 10 cell types in breast cancer lesions utilizing radiomic features extracted from breast Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Methods: We performed a retrospective study utilizing 73 patients from two independent institutions with imaging and gene expression data provided by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively. A set of 199 radiomic features including shape-based, morphological, texture, and kinetic characteristics were extracted from the lesion volumes. To capture one-to-one relationships between radiomic features and cell type abundance, we performed linear regression on each radiomic feature/cell type abundance combination. Each regression model was tested for statistical significance. In addition, multivariate models were built for the cell type infiltration status (i.e. “high” vs “low”) prediction. A feature selection process via Recursive Feature Elimination was applied to the radiomic features on the training set. The classification models took the form of a binary logistic extreme gradient boosting framework. Two evaluation methods including leave-one-out cross validation and external independent test, were used for radiomic model learning and testing. The models’ performance was measured via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Univariate relationships were identified between a set of radiomic features and the abundance of fibroblasts. Multivariate models yielded leave-one-out cross validation AUCs ranging from 0.5 to 0.83, and independent test AUCs ranging from 0.5 to 0.68 for the multiple cell type invasion predictions. Conclusions: On two independent breast cancer cohorts, breast MRI-derived radiomics are associated with the tumor’s microenvironment in terms of the abundance of several cell types. Further evaluation with larger cohorts is needed.","author":[{"family":"Arefan","given":"Dooman"},{"family":"Hausler","given":"Ryan M."},{"family":"Sumkin","given":"Jules H."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Min"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shandong"}],"citation-key":"arefanPredictingCellInvasion2021","container-title":"BMC Cancer","DOI":"10.1186/s12885-021-08122-x","ISSN":"14712407","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"PMID":"33827490","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","title":"Predicting cell invasion in breast tumor microenvironment from radiological imaging phenotypes","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

The development of quantitative imaging methods along with machine learning has enabled the opportunity to move data science research towards translation for more personalized cancer treatments. Accumulating evidence has indeed demonstrated that noninvasive advanced imaging analytics, that is, radiomics, can reveal key components of tumor phenotype for multiple three-dimensional lesions at multiple time points over and beyond the course of treatment. These developments in the use of CT, PET, US, and MR imaging could augment patient stratification and prognostication buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches.

Many powerful open-source and commercial platforms are currently available to embark in new research areas of radiomics. Quantitative imaging research, however, is complex and key statistical principles should be followed to realize its full potential. The field of radiomics, in particular, requires a renewed focus on optimal study design/reporting practices and standardization of image acquisition, feature calculation, and rigorous statistical analysis for the field to move forward.

  {"id":"aversanoThyroidDiseaseTreatment2021","abstract":"The thyroid is an endocrine gland located in the anterior region of the neck: its main task is to produce thyroid hormones, which are functional to our entire body. Its possible dysfunction can lead to the production of an insufficient or excessive amount of thyroid hormone. Therefore, the thyroid can become inflamed or swollen due to one or more swellings forming inside it. Some of these nodules can be the site of malignant tumors. One of the most used treatments is sodium levothyroxine, also known as LT4, a synthetic thyroid hormone used in the treatment of thyroid disorders and diseases. Predictions about the treatment can be important for supporting endocrinologists' activities and improve the quality of the patients' life. To date, there are numerous studies in the literature that focus on the prediction of thyroid diseases on the trend of the hormonal parameters of people. This work, differently, aims to predict the LT4 treatment trend for patients suffering from hypothyroidism. To this end, a dedicated dataset was built that includes medical information related to patients being treated in the”AOU Federico II” hospital of Naples. For each patient, the clinical history is available over time, and therefore on the basis of the trend of the hormonal parameters and other attributes considered it was possible to predict the course of each patient's treatment in order to understand if this should be increased or decreased.

  {"id":"ayvazReducingOperationCosts2022","abstract":"Continuous advancement in the health sector is essential to reduce costs and increase efficiency and quality of service. The widespread use of ultrasonography (USG) has made it possible to detect thyroid nodules with higher success rates. Some standard scoring systems have been developed to score thyroid nodules. Thyroid scoring systems are classification systems that determine the risk of cancer in thyroid nodules according to ultrasonographic characteristics and nodule size. Different scoring results for the same thyroid nodule may occur according to these different scoring systems, which can cause some unnecessary surgical interventions. In this study, some intelligent models are developed to assist thyroid scoring systems, with the aim to determine the correct surgical intervention and reduce operation costs by preventing unnecessary interventions and surgical procedures. The integration of current thyroid scoring systems (K-TIRADS, ACR-TIRADS, EU-TIRADS, ATA, and BTA) and machine learning methods provides radiologists and clinicians a decision-support mechanism in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Correct diagnosis will help to reduce costs by helping prevent unnecessary procedures. The present dataset was retrospectively constructed using ultrasound images of thyroid nodules between 2014 and 2018. In determining the treatment process of thyroid nodules, Random Forest, Adaboost, J48 Decision Tree (J48 DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are used for increased prediction accuracy of thyroid scoring systems. The goal is to decrease redundant Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies and surgical interventions of suspicious thyroid nodules.

  {"id":"baiThyroidNodulesRisk2020","abstract":"Purpose: Clinically, the risk stratification of thyroid nodules is usually used to formulate the next treatment plan. The American College of Radiology (ACR) thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS) is a type of medical standard widely used in classification diagnosis. It divides the nodule’s ACR TI-RADS level into five levels by quantitative scoring, from benign to high suspicion of malignancy. However, such assessment often relies on the radiologists’ experience and is time consuming. So computer-aided diagnosis is necessary. But many deep learning (DL) models are difficult for doctors to understand, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. In this work, we mainly focus on how to achieve automatic thyroid nodules risk stratification based on deep integration of deep learning and clinical experience. Methods: An automatic hierarchical method of thyroid nodules risk based on deep learning is proposed, called risk stratification network (RS-Net). It incorporates medical experience based on ACR TI-RADS. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify the five categories in ACR TI-RADS and assign their points respectively. According to the point totals, the level of risk can be obtained. In addition, a dataset involving 13 984 thyroid ultrasound images is established to develop and evaluate the proposed method. Results: We have extensively compared the results of this paper with the evaluation results of sonographers. The accuracy of the risk stratification (TR1 to TR5) of the proposed method is 65%, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.54. The MAE of the point totals (0 to 13 points) is 1.67. The Pearson's correlation between our method evaluation and doctor evaluation reached 0.84. For the benign and malignant classification, the performance indices accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 88.0%, 98.1%, 79.1%, 80.5%, and 97.9%, respectively. Our method's level of thyroid nodules risk stratification is comparable to that of a senior doctor. Conclusions: This work provides a way to automate the risk stratification of thyroid nodules. Our method can effectively avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis caused by the difference of observers so as to assist doctors to improve efficiency and diagnosis rate. Compared with the previous benign and malignant classification, the proposed method incorporates clinical experience. So it can greatly increase the clinicians’ trust in the DL model, thereby improving the applicability of the model in clinical practice.","author":[{"family":"Bai","given":"Ziyu"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Luchen"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Ruiguo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xuewei"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Mei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhiqiang"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jialin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yulin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuaijie"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhuo"}],"citation-key":"baiThyroidNodulesRisk2020","container-title":"Medical Physics","DOI":"10.1002/mp.14543","ISSN":"24734209","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"page":"6355-6365","PMID":"33089513","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Ltd","title":"Thyroid nodules risk stratification through deep learning based on ultrasound images","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

Additional challenges include the presence of artefacts, limited data availability, and overfitting issues associated with deep learning architectures. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that accurately classifies skin lesions using both a publicly available ISIC 2019 challenge dataset and a private dataset. The study introduces three main tasks to achieve this objective. Task 1 focuses on improving data quality by addressing imbalanced class distribution, missing values, and der-moscopic multi-resolutions. Task 2 involves developing the CAD system using transfer learning with a pretrained Noisy Student (EfficientNet-L2) architecture, incorporating additional metadata through a dense neural network concatenated with the CNN output.

The accurate diagnosis of these lesions is one of the most challenges for dermapathologists; this is due to the high similarities between them. Data mining techniques are successfully applied to situations like these where complexity exists. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence model to support the diagnosis of Spitzoid lesions. A private spitzoid lesions dataset have been used to evaluate the system proposed in this study. The proposed system has three stages. In the first stage, SMOTE method applied to solve the imbalance data problem, in the second stage, in order to eliminate irrelevant features; genetic algorithm is used to select significant features. This later reduces the computational complexity and speed up the data mining process. In the third stage, Random forest classifier is employed to make a decision for two different categories of lesions (Spitz nevus or Atypical Spitz Tumors). The performance of our proposed scheme is evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, F-measure, ROC and AUC. Results obtained with our SMOTE-GA-RF model with GA-based 16 features show a great performance with accuracy 0.97, F-measure 0.98, AUC 0.98, and G-mean 0.97.Results obtained in this study have potential to open new opportunities in diagnosis of spitzoid lesions.","author":[{"family":"Belaala","given":"Abir"},{"family":"Sadek Terrissa","given":"Labib"},{"family":"Zerhouni","given":"Noureddine"},{"family":"Devalland","given":"Christine"}],"citation-key":"belaalaSpitzoidLesionsDiagnosis","title":"Spitzoid Lesions Diagnosis based on GA feature selection and Random Forest","type":"report"},
  {"id":"bhattacharyaAdvancesChallengesThyroid2023","abstract":"Thyroid cancer continues to exhibit a rising incidence globally, predominantly affecting women. Despite stable mortality rates, the unique characteristics of thyroid carcinoma warrant a distinct approach. Differentiated thyroid cancer, comprising most cases, is effectively managed through standard treatments such as thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy. However, rarer variants, including anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, necessitate specialized interventions, often employing targeted therapies. Although these drugs focus on symptom management, they are not curative. This review delves into the fundamental modulators of thyroid cancers, encompassing genetic, epigenetic, and non-coding RNA factors while exploring their intricate interplay and influence. Epigenetic modifications directly affect the expression of causal genes, while long non-coding RNAs impact the function and expression of micro-RNAs, culminating in tumorigenesis. Additionally, this article provides a concise overview of the advantages and disadvantages associated with pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions in thyroid cancer. Furthermore, with technological advancements, integrating modern software and computing into healthcare and medical practices has become increasingly prevalent. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques hold the potential to predict treatment outcomes, analyze data, and develop personalized therapeutic approaches catering to patient specificity. In thyroid cancer, cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning technologies analyze factors such as ultrasonography results for tumor textures and biopsy samples from fine needle aspirations, paving the way for a more accurate and effective therapeutic landscape in the near future.","author":[{"family":"Bhattacharya","given":"Srinjan"},{"family":"Mahato","given":"Rahul Kumar"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Satwinder"},{"family":"Bhatti","given":"Gurjit Kaur"},{"family":"Mastana","given":"Sarabjit Singh"},{"family":"Bhatti","given":"Jasvinder Singh"}],"citation-key":"bhattacharyaAdvancesChallengesThyroid2023","container-title":"Life Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122110","ISSN":"00243205","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"page":"122110","publisher":"Elsevier BV","title":"Advances and challenges in thyroid cancer: The interplay of genetic modulators, targeted therapies, and AI-driven approaches","type":"article-journal"},

These findings can often lead to a diagnostic dilemma, as the CT reflects the nonspecific appearances. Ultrasound (US) examination has a superior spatial resolution and is considered the modality of choice for thyroid evaluation. Nevertheless, CT detects incidental thyroid nodules (ITNs) and plays an important role in the evaluation of thyroid cancer. In this pictorial review, we cover a wide spectrum of common and uncommon, incidental and non-incidental thyroid findings from CT scans. We also discuss the most common incidental thyroid findings, best practices for their evaluation, and recommendations for their management. In addition, we explore the role of imaging in the assessment of thyroid carcinoma (before and after treatment) and preoperative thyroid goiter, as well as localization of ectopic and congenital thyroid tissue. Teaching Points: • Thyroid disorders tend to have non-specific CT appearances. • ITNs are common on neck CT. • ITN management depends on nodule size, age, health status, lymphadenopathy, and invasion. • CT is used in assessment of cancer extension, mass effect, invasion, and recurrence. • CT plays a role in preoperative planning in patients with symptomatic goiter.","author":[{"family":"Bin Saeedan","given":"Mnahi"},{"family":"Aljohani","given":"Ibtisam Musallam"},{"family":"Khushaim","given":"Ayman Omar"},{"family":"Bukhari","given":"Salwa Qasim"},{"family":"Elnaas","given":"Salahudin Tayeb"}],"citation-key":"binsaeedanThyroidComputedTomography2016","container-title":"Insights into Imaging","DOI":"10.1007/s13244-016-0506-5","ISSN":"18694101","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,1]]},"page":"601-617","publisher":"Springer Verlag","title":"Thyroid computed tomography imaging: pictorial review of variable pathologies","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"bothaAmericanCollegeRadiology2020","abstract":"Background: Thyroid nodules are common, the majority benign. The small risk of malignancy leads to excessive workup. Thyroid ultrasound is essential for risk stratification and management guidance. Without an organised reporting guideline, reports do not add significant value to referring clinicians. The American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) was developed to aid ultrasound reporting, lessen excessive biopsies and diagnose thyroid cancers. Objectives: To standardise reporting of thyroid ultrasounds by utilising an organised reporting guideline based on ACR TI-RADS. Method: Thyroid ultrasound reports generated by radiology registrars at an academic hospital were studied in two phases. In Phase 1, the reports were generated as free text, and in Phase 2, using a guideline based on ACR TI-RADS. The percentages of reports that described the maximum size, the five ACR TI-RADS features and a management recommendation were compared. Results: A total of 130 reports were studied. Significant improvement was observed in the description of all five ACR TI-RADS categories (p < 0.0001) from Phase 1 to Phase 2. Of all the reports, 89% included a management recommendation. Reports including an ACR TI-RADS-based recommendation increased from 48% to 75% (p < 0.05). Recommendation for biopsy increased from 35.4% to 53.8% (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Introduction of an organised reporting guideline based on ACR TI-RADS, standardised reporting of thyroid ultrasounds by increasing description of thyroid nodule features and ensuring appropriate management recommendations.

  {"id":"buscombeNuclearMedicineManagement2008","abstract":"Thyroid disease management has changed little over the last 60 years and recent work suggests that the older approach remains the most effective. Treatment of benign hyperthyroidism has shown that functional imaging is essentially linked to therapy and uptake of iodine-131 (131I) cannot be assumed but should be tested by pre-imaging with radioisotopes as 10% of patients may not be suitable for 131I therapy and 1% may have a coexistent cancer. Differentiated thyroid cancer remains unique in that it is almost alone among common solid tumors in that it is routinely cured even if cannot all be removed by surgery. This is achieved in the majority of patients by a treatment introduced in the 1940s and does not involve the use of chemotherapy drugs but a simple and cheap isotope preparation: 131I. However, in some differentiated thyroid cancers there is no accumulation of 131I and we know this is due to the loss, or downregulation of the sodium iodide symporter gene. This has led to the development of several strategies to overcome this loss/downregulation, for example with the use of lithium or retinoids or gene treatment. However, all these approaches have yet to be proved in a randomized controlled trial. Advances in imaging especially using 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose PET has enabled patients with thyroid cancer to be more accurately imaged, resulting in a greater chance of cure through surgery and external-beam radiotherapy, especially if uptake of 131I is poor. Another approach has been the idea of using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, which are able to demonstrate uptake in the tumor and, more recently, β-emitting isotopes have been used for therapy when other options have failed. Therefore, whilst the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer is, to some degree, 60 years old, new methods have been proposed and are now being tested in this disease. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Buscombe","given":"John"},{"family":"Hirji","given":"Hassan"},{"family":"Witney-Smith","given":"Caroline"}],"citation-key":"buscombeNuclearMedicineManagement2008","container-title":"Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy","DOI":"10.1586/14737140.8.9.1425","ISSN":"14737140","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"1425-1431","PMID":"18759694","title":"Nuclear medicine in the management of thyroid disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

Most lung cancers are discovered in the middle and late stages of the disease, when treatment choices are limited, and patients’ survival rate is low. The aim of lung cancer screening is the identification of lung malignancies in the early stage of the disease, when more options for effective treatments are available, to improve the patients’ outcomes. The desire to improve the efficacy and efficiency of clinical care continues to drive multiple innovations into practice for better patient management, and in this context, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a key role.

The present study evaluated the ability of PET metrics and radiomics features to predict final diagnosis of [18F]FDG thyroid incidentalomas (TIs). Methods: A total of 104 patients with 107 TIs were retrospectively studied; 30 nodules (28%) were diagnosed as malignant. After volumetric segmentation of each thyroid lesion, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), standardized uptake values (SUVs), and metabolic heterogeneity were estimated, and 107 radiomics features were extracted following a standard protocol. Results: MTV, TLG, SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak among functional PET parameters, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)_InverseDifferenceMoment, shape_Sphericity, GLCM_SumSquares, firstorder_Maximum2DDiameterSlice, firstorder_Energy, and GLCM_Contrast among nonredundant radiomics features, showed significantly different values between malignant and benign TIs (Mann-Whitney U-test, p < 0.01 for all). Univariate logistic regression revealed that these parameters demonstrated good ability to predict final diagnosis of TIs (p < 0.02 for all). Shape_Sphericity was the best predictor classifying 82% of TIs correctly (p < 0.0001). Only TLG, SUVmax, and shape_Sphericity retained significance (p < 0.0001) by multivariate analysis. Malignant lesion prevalence increased from 7% to 100% in accordance with the number (score, 0-3) of the three positive parameters present (χ2 trend, p < 0.0001). A score of 0 excludes malignant TIs with a negative predictive value of 93%, while a score of 3 predicted malignancy with a positive predictive value of 100%. Conclusions: PET metrics and radiomics analysis can improve identification of [18F]FDG-avid TIs at high risk of malignancy.

To overcome these limitations, this study presents an approach that investigates feature engineering for machine learning and deep learning models. Forward feature selection, backward feature elimination, bidirectional feature elimination, and machine learning-based feature selection using extra tree classifiers are adopted. The proposed approach can predict Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (primary hypothyroid), binding protein (increased binding protein), autoimmune thyroiditis (compensated hypothyroid), and non-thyroidal syndrome (NTIS) (concurrent non-thyroidal illness). Extensive experiments show that the extra tree classifier-based selected feature yields the best results with 0.99 accuracy and an F1 score when used with the random forest classifier. Results suggest that the machine learning models are a better choice for thyroid disease detection regarding the provided accuracy and the computational complexity. K-fold cross-validation and performance comparison with existing studies corroborate the superior performance of the proposed approach.","author":[{"family":"Chaganti","given":"Rajasekhar"},{"family":"Rustam","given":"Furqan"},{"family":"De La Torre Díez","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Mazón","given":"Juan Luis Vidal"},{"family":"Rodríguez","given":"Carmen Lili"},{"family":"Ashraf","given":"Imran"}],"citation-key":"chagantiThyroidDiseasePrediction2022","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers14163914","ISSN":"20726694","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,1]]},"publisher":"MDPI","title":"Thyroid Disease Prediction Using Selective Features and Machine Learning Techniques","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"chakrabortyBRAFV600EMutationPapillary2012","abstract":"B-Raf (BRAF) is the strongest activator in the downstream of MAP kinase signaling. The somatic point mutation of BRAF gene (V600E) is the most common and specific event in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, its prevalence is variable among different studies and its association with clinico-pathological features is controversial. This study tests the prevalence of BRAFV600E mutation in thyroid cancer patients in Indian subcontinental population. We analyzed 140 thyroid tumor specimens for BRAF gene mutation at codon 600 using mutant-allele-specific amplification, single-strand conformation polymorphism, Mutector assay, and DNA sequencing of the PCR-amplified exon 15. BRAF mutation at codon 600 was detected in 46 of 86 PTC patients (53.4%) from Indian subcontinental cohort. Frequency of mutation varied across the subtypes of PTCs. BRAFV600E mutation was more common in the conventional PTC (38 out of 62; 61%) than in the follicular variant of PTC (2 out of 17; 11.7%). None of the 8 follicular thyroid adenomas, 14 follicular thyroid carcinomas, 16 medullary thyroid carcinomas, and 16 benign hyperplasia patients showed any exon 15 mutation. We found significant correlation between BRAF mutation status and extra-thyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor stage. However no correlation was observed with gender, age, and tumor size of the patients. Thus our findings suggest that BRAFV600E is a prevalent genetic alteration in adult sporadic PTCs in Indian cohort and it may be responsible for the progression of classic variant of PTC to metastatic and poorly differentiated subtype and likely to have significant impact on its diagnostic and prognostic management. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","author":[{"family":"Chakraborty","given":"Avik"},{"family":"Narkar","given":"Archana"},{"family":"Mukhopadhyaya","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Kane","given":"Shubhada"},{"family":"D'Cruz","given":"Anil"},{"family":"Rajan","given":"M.

  {"id":"changIntegratedNomogramCombining2023","abstract":"Objective: Central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is a predictor of poor prognosis for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. The options for surgeon operation or follow-up depend on the state of CLNM while accurate prediction is a challenge for radiologists. The present study aimed to develop and validate an effective preoperative nomogram combining deep learning, clinical characteristics and ultrasound features for predicting CLNM. Materials and methods: In this study, 3359 PTC patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy from two medical centers were enrolled. The patients were divided into three datasets for training, internal validation and external validation. We constructed an integrated nomogram combining deep learning, clinical characteristics and ultrasound features using multivariable logistic regression to predict CLNM in PTC patients. Results: Multivariate analysis indicated that the AI model-predicted value, multiple, position, microcalcification, abutment/perimeter ratio and US-reported LN status were independent risk factors predicting CLNM. The area under the curve (AUC) for the nomogram to predict CLNM was 0.812 (95% CI, 0.794-0.830) in the training cohort, 0.809 (95% CI, 0.780-0.837) in the internal validation cohort and 0.829(95%CI, 0.785-0.872) in the external validation cohort. Based on the analysis of the decision curve, our integrated nomogram was superior to other models in terms of clinical predictive ability.

Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 313 pathologically diagnosed thyroid nodules (203 malignant and 110 benign). Two 2D-US images and five CEUS key frames (“2nd second after the arrival time” frame, “time to peak” frame, “2nd second after peak” frame, “first-flash” frame, and “second-flash” frame) were selected to manually label the region of interest using the “Labelme” tool. A total of 7 images of each nodule and their annotates were imported into the Darwin Research Platform for radiomics analysis. The datasets were randomly split into training and test cohorts in a 9:1 ratio. Six classifiers, namely, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree and extreme gradient boosting, were used to construct and test the models. Performance was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy (ACC), and F1-score were calculated. One junior radiologist and one senior radiologist reviewed the 2D-US image and CEUS videos of each nodule and made a diagnosis. We then compared their AUC and ACC with those of our best model. Results: The AUC of the diagnosis of US, CEUS and US combined CEUS by junior radiologist and senior radiologist were 0.755, 0.750, 0.784, 0.800, 0.873, 0.890, respectively. The RF classifier performed better than the other five, with an AUC of 1 for the training cohort and 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.88–1) for the test cohort. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, and F1-score of the RF model in the test cohort were 0.82, 0.93, 0.90, 0.85, 0.92, and 0.84, respectively. The RF model with 2D-US combined with CEUS key frames achieved equivalent performance as the senior radiologist (AUC: 0.94 vs. 0.92, P = 0.798; ACC: 0.90 vs. 0.92) and outperformed the junior radiologist (AUC: 0.94 vs. 0.80, P = 0.039, ACC: 0.90 vs. 0.81) in the test cohort.

Purpose: To develop an artificial intelligence model based on American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System characteristics for diagnosing thyroid nodules and identifying nodule characteristics (hereafter, MTI-RADS) and to compare the performance of MTI-RADS, radiologists, and a model trained on benign and malignant status based on surgical histopathologic analysis (hereafter, MDiag). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 1588 surgically proven nodules from 636 consecutive patients (mean age, 49 years 6 14 [SD]; 485 women) were included. MTI-RADS and MDiag were trained on US images of 1345 nodules (January 2018 to December 2019). The performance of MTI-RADS was compared with that of MDiag and radiologists with different experience levels on the test data set (243 nodules, January 2019 to December 2019) with the DeLong method and McNemar test. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity of MTI-RADS were 0.91 and 83% (55 of 66 nodules), respectively, which were not significantly different from those of experienced radiologists (0.93 [P = .45] and 92% [61 of 66 nodules; P = .07]) and exceeded those of junior radiologists (0.78 [P , .001] and 70% [46 of 66 nodules; P = .04]). The specificity of MTI-RADS (87% [154 of 177 nodules]) was higher than that of both experienced and junior radiologists (80% [141 of 177 nodules; P = .02] and 75% [133 of 177 nodules; P = .001], respectively). The AUC of MTI-RADS was higher than that of MDiag (0.91 vs 0.84, respectively; P = .001). In the test set of 243 nodules, the consistency rates between MTI-RADS and the experienced group were higher than those between MTI-RADS and the junior group for composition (79% [n = 193] vs 73% [n = 178], respectively; P = .02), echogenicity (75% [n = 183] vs 68% [n = 166]; P = .04), shape (93% [n = 227] vs 88% [n = 215]; P = .04), and smooth or ill-defined margin (72% [n = 174] vs 63% [n = 152]; P = .002).

  {"id":"chenDiagnosisThyroidNodules2020","abstract":"Background: Various combinations of ultrasonographic (US) characteristics are increasingly utilized to classify thyroid nodules. But they lack theories, and heavily depend on radiologists' experience, and cannot correctly classify thyroid nodules. Hence, our main purpose of this manuscript is to select the US characteristics significantly associated with malignancy and to develop an efficient scoring system for facilitating ultrasonic clinicians to correctly identify thyroid malignancy. Methods: A logistic regression (LR) model is utilized to identify the potential thyroid malignancy, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method is adopted to simultaneously select US characteristics significantly associated with malignancy and estimate parameters in LR model. Based on the selected US characteristics, we calculate the probability for each of thyroid nodules via random forest (RF) and extreme learning machine (ELM), and develop a scoring system to classify thyroid nodules. For comparison, we also consider eight state-of-the-art methods such as support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NET), etc. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is employed to measure the accuracy of various classifiers. Results: The US characteristics: nodule size, AP/T≥1, solid component, micro-calcifications, hackly border, hypoechogenicity, presence of halo, unclear border, irregular margin, and central vascularity are selected as the significant predictors associated with thyroid malignancy via the LASSO LR (LLR). Using the developed scoring system, thyroid nodules are classified into the following four categories: benign, low suspicion, intermediate suspicion, and high suspicion, whose rates of malignancy correctly identified for RF (ELM) method on the testing dataset are 0.0% (4.3%), 14.3% (50.0%), 58.1% (59.1%) and 96.1% (97.7%), respectively. Conclusion: LLR together with RF performs better than other methods in identifying malignancy, especially for abnormal nodules, in terms of risk scores. The developed scoring system can well predict the risk of malignancy and guide medical doctors to make management decisions for reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies for benign nodules.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Mei"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Niansheng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Yuran"}],"citation-key":"chenDiagnosisThyroidNodules2020","container-title":"BioData Mining","DOI":"10.1186/s13040-020-00223-w","ISSN":"17560381","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,3]]},"publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","title":"Diagnosis of thyroid nodules for ultrasonographic characteristics indicative of malignancy using random forest","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"chenInnovativeAnalysisDistant2020","abstract":"Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common thyroid cancer with a relatively high survival rate. The association between certain risk factors of distant metastasis (DM) remains uncertain. In order to assess the prognosis of patients with DTC better, the present study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects between histologic subtype, tumor size, lymph node metastasis (LNM) status and extrathyroidal extension (ETE) on the incidence of DM in DTC. Data of 96,788 patients with DTC were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. The association between clinicopathological factors and DM was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. The synergistic effects of relevant factors were determined by measuring the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP) and synergy index (SI). The results demonstrated that tumor size, LNM status, histologic subtype and ETE were independent risk factors for DM [odds ratio (OR)=2.433; P<0.001; OR=3.998; P<0.001; OR=6.266; P<0.001; and OR=3.873; P<0.001, respectively]. In addition, a significant additive synergistic effect on DM was identified between ETE and histologic subtype, ETE and LNM status, as well as between ETE and tumor size (RERI=34.097; AP=0.706; SI=3.585; RERI=6.425; AP=0.410; SI=1.781; and RERI=76.973; AP=0.864; SI=7.930, respectively). Therefore, the results of this study revealed that ETE with follicular thyroid histology, N1 stage or large tumor size may have a synergistic effect on the risk of DM in patients with DTC. These results suggested that individualized treatment may benefit patients with DTC, and when ETE coexists with one of the identified risk factors, radical treatments may be required.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Danyang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Sichao"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yihui"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Di"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Min"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Haifeng"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zeming"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Liang"}],"citation-key":"chenInnovativeAnalysisDistant2020","container-title":"Oncology Letters","DOI":"10.3892/ol.2020.11304","ISSN":"17921082","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1985-1992","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","title":"Innovative analysis of distant metastasis in differentiated thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

In this study, RNA sequencing data of PTC samples and normal samples were obtained from GSE33630 and GSE29265. Then, we analyzed GSE33630 datasets and identified 127 DE-ARGs. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that 127 DE-ARGs were mainly enriched in pathways in cancer, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, toll-like receptor pathway, MAPK pathway, apoptosis, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and regulation of autophagy. Subsequently, CALCOCO2, DAPK1, and RAC1 among the 127 DE-ARGs were identified as diagnostic genes by support vector machine recursive feature elimination and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms. Then, we developed a novel diagnostic model using CALCOCO2, DAPK1, and RAC1 and its diagnostic value was confirmed in GSE29265 and our cohorts. Importantly, CALCOCO2 may be a critical regulator involved in immune microenvironment because its expression was related to many types of immune cells.

  {"id":"chenUltrasoundbasedRadiomicsclinicalMachine2024","abstract":"Background: Conventional ultrasound (CUS) technology has proven to be successful in the identification of thyroid nodules. Moreover, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) was developed for the purpose of evaluating the risk of thyroid nodules based on ultrasound imaging. Nevertheless, identifying papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) from TI-RADS 3 nodules using this system can be difficult due to overlapping morphological features. The main objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a machine learning model that utilizes ultrasound-based radiomics features and clinical information in accurately predicting the presence of PTMC in TI-RADS 3 nodules. Methods: A total of 221 patients with TI-RADS 3 nodules were included, consisting of 91 cases of PTMC and 130 benign thyroid nodules. They were randomly divided into training and test cohort in an 8:2 ratio. Radiomics features were extracted from CUS images by manually outlining the targets, while clinical parameters were obtained from electronic medical records. The radiomics model, clinical model, and combined model were constructed and validated to distinguish between PTMC and benign thyroid nodules. Radiomics variables were extracted via the Pyradiomics package (V1.3.0). Moreover, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for feature selection. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) was employed to build both radiomics and clinical models. Ultimately, a radiomics-clinical model, which fused radiomics features with clinical information, was developed. Results: Among a total of 1,477 radiomics features, fifteen features that were found to be associated with PTMC through univariate analysis and LASSO regression were selected for the development of the radiomics model. The combined \"radiomics-clinical\" model demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy compared to the clinical model for distinguishing PTMC in both the training dataset [area under receiver operating curve (AUC): 0.975 vs. 0.845] and the validation dataset (AUC: 0.898 vs. 0.811).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ovid-MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up until 12 June 2018. Eleven articles were included in the qualitative systematic review and nine of the 11 in the quantitative analysis. Two radiologists independently performed data extraction and methodological quality assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. A qualitative systematic review and quantitative analysis were performed, followed by a meta-regression analysis to determine factors causing heterogeneity. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes were 80% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68–88%) and 85% (95% CI: 63–95%), respectively. The sensitivity and false-positive rate (correlation coefficient, 0.655) showed a positive correlation due to a threshold effect, which was responsible for heterogeneity across the studies, as indicated by a Q-test (p<0.01) and Higgins I2 statistic (sensitivity, I2=90.11%; specificity, I2=92.49%).

  {"id":"chongPreoperativeLymphNode2017","abstract":"Objectives. The purpose of this study was to compare lymph node (LN) staging using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with contrast-enhancement (CE) PET/CT and contrast-enhanced neck CT (neck CT) in patients with thyroid cancer with level-by-level comparison with various factors. Methods. This was a retrospective multicenter study. A total of 85 patients were enrolled. Patients who underwent a preoperative evaluation by CE PET/CT and neck CT for thyroid cancer were enrolled. The gold standard for LN was the combination of surgical pathology and clinical follow-up. We compared CE PET/CT with neck CT using a level-by-level method. Factors, including age, sex, camera, arm position, tumor size, extra-thyroidal extension, tumor location, number of primary tumors, primary tumor maximum standardized uptake value, and the interval from scan to operation were also analyzed. Results. Overall accuracy was 81.2% for CE PET/CT and 68.2% for neck CT. CE PET/CT was more sensitive than neck CT (65.8% vs. 44.7%). Also, CE PET/CT showed higher negative predictive value (77.2% vs. 66.1%). CE PET/CT showed good agreement with the gold standard (weighted kappa [κ], 0.7) for differentiating N0, N1a, and N1b, whereas neck CT showed moderate agreement (weighted κ, 0.5). CE PET/CT showed better agreement for the number of levels involved with the gold standard (weighted κ, 0.7) than that of neck CT with the gold standard (weighted κ, 0.5). The accuracies for differentiating N0, N1a, and N1b were 81.2% for CE PET/CT and 68.2% for neck CT. Level-by-level analysis showed that CE PET/CT was more sensitive and has higher negative predictive value for detecting ipsilateral level IV and level VI LNs than neck CT. Other analyzed factors were not related to accuracies of both modalities. Conclusion. CE PET/CT was more sensitive and reliable than neck CT for preoperative LN staging in patients with thyroid cancer.","author":[{"family":"Chong","given":"Ari"},{"family":"Ha","given":"Jung Min"},{"family":"Han","given":"Yeon Hee"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Eunjung"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Yunjung"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Ki Hwan"},{"family":"Park","given":"Jun Hee"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sung Hoon"},{"family":"Park","given":"Jung Mi"}],"citation-key":"chongPreoperativeLymphNode2017","container-title":"Clinical and Experimental Otorhinolaryngology","DOI":"10.21053/ceo.2015.01424","ISSN":"20050720","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,1]]},"page":"121-128","publisher":"Korean Society of Otolaryngology","title":"Preoperative lymph node staging by FDG PET/CT with contrast enhancement for thyroid cancer: A multicenter study and comparison with neck CT","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"cibas2017BethesdaSystem2017","abstract":"The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) established a standardized, category-based reporting system for thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens. The 2017 revision reaffirms that every thyroid FNA report should begin with one of six diagnostic categories, the names of which remain unchanged since they were first introduced: (i) nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory; (ii) benign; (iii) atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS); (iv) follicular neoplasm or suspicious for a follicular neoplasm; (v) suspicious for malignancy; and (vi) malignant. There is a choice of two different names for some of the categories. A laboratory should choose the one it prefers and use it exclusively for that category. Synonymous terms (e.g., AUS and FLUS) should not be used to denote two distinct interpretations. Each category has an implied cancer risk that ranges from 0% to 3% for the \"benign\" category to virtually 100% for the \"malignant\" category, and, in the 2017 revision, the malignancy risks have been updated based on new (post 2010) data. As a function of their risk associations, each category is linked to updated, evidence-based clinical management recommendations. The recent reclassification of some thyroid neoplasms as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) has implications for the risk of malignancy, and this is accounted for with regard to diagnostic criteria and optional notes. Such notes can be useful in helping guide surgical management.","author":[{"family":"Cibas","given":"Edmund S."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Syed Z."}],"citation-key":"cibas2017BethesdaSystem2017","container-title":"Thyroid","DOI":"10.1089/thy.2017.0500","ISSN":"15579077","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,1]]},"page":"1341-1346","PMID":"29091573","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","title":"The 2017 Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

Radiomics is a field that uses radiological features to inform individualized patient care. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of radiomics in classifying undetermined thyroid nodules into benign and malignant using ultrasonography (US). Methods: A diagnostic test accuracy systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) delineating benign and malignant lesions were recorded. Results: Seventy-five studies including 26,373 patients and 46,175 thyroid nodules met inclusion criteria. Males accounted for 24.6% of patients, while 75.4% of patients were female. Radiomics provided a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86–0.87) and a pooled specificity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.84–0.85) for characterizing benign and malignant lesions. Using convolutional neural network (CNN) methods, pooled sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.84–0.86) and pooled specificity was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.82–0.83); significantly lower than studies using non-CNN: sensitivity 0.90 (95% CI: 0.89–0.90) and specificity 0.88 (95% CI: 0.87–0.89) (p &lt; 0.05).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of machine learning-(ML-) based quantitative texture analysis in the differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Materials and methods. A sum of 306 quantitative textural features of 235 thyroid nodules (102 malignant, 43.4%; 133 benign, 56.4%) of a total of 198 patients were investigated using the random forest ML classifier. Feature selection and dimension reduction were conducted using reproducibility testing and a wrapper method. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) of the proposed method were compared with the histopathological or cytopathological findings as reference methods. Results. Of the 306 initial texture features, 284 (92.2%) showed good reproducibility (intraclass correlation ≥0.80). The random forest classifier accurately identified 87 out of 102 malignant thyroid nodules and 117 out of 133 benign thyroid nodules, which is a diagnostic sensitivity of 85.2%, specificity of 87.9%, and accuracy of 86.8%. The AUC of the model was 0.92. Conclusions. Quantitative textural analysis of thyroid nodules using ML classification can accurately discriminate benign and malignant thyroid nodules.

  {"id":"coutoCutoffThyroglobulinValue2020","abstract":"Serum thyroglobulin is used as part of the early postoperative assessment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) since there is a clear relationship between an increased risk of recurrence and persistent disease after initial treatment and high postoperative stimulated thyroglobulin (ps-Tg) values. Thus, although ps-Tg above 10–30 ng/mL is considered an independent predictor of worse prognosis, the value that is associated with distant metastases is not defined. Thus, this was our objective. We selected 655 DTC patients from a nuclear medicine department database (Irmandade Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo, Brazil). All patients had received total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy and had ps-Tg values higher than 10 ng/mL with negative anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. Then, we selected patients who presented post-therapy whole-body scan with pulmonary and/or bone uptake but with no mediastinum or cervical uptake. Patients with negative findings on functional imaging or any doubt on lung/bone uptake were submitted to additional exams to exclude another non-thyroid tumor. Of the 655 patients, 14.3% had pulmonary and 4.4% bone metastases. There was a significant difference in ps-Tg levels between patients with and without metastases (Po0.001). The cutoff value of ps-Tg was 117.5 ng/mL (sensitivity: 70.2%; specificity: 71.7%) for those with lung metastasis, and 150.5 ng/mL (sensitivity: 79.3%; specificity: 85%) for those with bone metastasis. The cutoff value for patients with eitherpulmonary or bone metastasis was 117.5 ng/mL (sensitivity: 70.2%; specificity: 83.7%).

This study aims to evaluate the association between PM2.5 and PTC and determine the subgroups of patients who are at the highest risk of PTC diagnosis. Methods: Under IRB approval, we conducted a case-control study of adult patients (age ≥ 18) newly diagnosed with PTC between 1/2013–12/2016 across a single health care system were identified using electronic medical records. These patients were compared to a control group of patients without any evidence of thyroid disease. Cumulative PM2.5 exposure was calculated for each patient using a deep learning neural networks model, which incorporated meteorological and satellite-based measurements at the patients’ residential zip code. Adjusted multivariate logistic regression was used to quantify the association between cumulative PM2.5 exposure and PTC diagnosis. We tested whether this association differed by gender, race, BMI, smoking history, current alcohol use, and median household income. Results: A cohort of 1990 patients with PTC and a control group of 6919 patients without thyroid disease were identified. Compared to the control group, patients with PTC were more likely to be older (51.2 vs. 48.8 years), female (75.5% vs 46.8%), White (75.2% vs. 61.6%), and never smokers (71.1% vs. 58.4%) (p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, current alcohol use, median household income, current smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, and asthma, 3-year cumulative PM2.5 exposure was associated with a 1.41-fold increased odds of PTC diagnosis (95%CI: 1.23–1.62). This association varied by median household income (p-interaction =0.03). Compared to those with a median annual household income <$50,000, patients with a median annual household income between $50,000 and < $100,000 had a 43% increased risk of PTC diagnosis (aOR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.19–1.72), and patients with median household income ≥$100,000 had a 77% increased risk of PTC diagnosis (aOR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.37–2.29). Conclusions: Cumulative exposure to PM2.5 over 3 years was significantly associated with the diagnosis of PTC. This association was most pronounced in those with a high median household income, suggesting a difference in access to care among socioeconomic groups.","author":[{"family":"Crepeau","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhenyu"},{"family":"Udyavar","given":"Rhea"},{"family":"Morris-Wiseman","given":"Lilah"},{"family":"Biswal","given":"Shyam"},{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"Murugappan"},{"family":"Mathur","given":"Aarti"}],"citation-key":"crepeauSocioeconomicDisparityAssociation2023","container-title":"Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source","DOI":"10.1186/s12940-023-00972-1","ISSN":"1476069X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"PMID":"36823621","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","title":"Socioeconomic disparity in the association between fine particulate matter exposure and papillary thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

US elastography provided new diagnostic information about elasticity comparing with the morphological feathers of traditional US, and thus expanded the scope of the application in clinic. US elastography is now widely used in the field of diagnosis and differential diagnosis of abnormality, evaluating the degree of fibrosis and assessment of treatment response for a range of diseases. The World Federation of Ultrasound Medicine and Biology divided elastographic techniques into strain elastography (SE), transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI). The ARFI techniques can be further classified into point shear wave elastography (SWE), 2D SWE, and 3D SWE techniques. The SE measures the strain, while the shear wave-based techniques (including TE and ARFI techniques) measure the speed of shear waves in tissues. In this review, we discuss the various techniques separately based on their basic principles, clinical applications in various organs, and advantages and limitations and which might be most appropriate given that the majority of doctors have access to only one kind of machine.","author":[{"family":"Cui","given":"Xin Wu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Kang Ning"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Ai Jiao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Ge Ge"},{"family":"Dietrich","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"cuiUltrasoundElastography2022","container-title":"Endoscopic Ultrasound","DOI":"10.4103/EUS-D-21-00151","ISSN":"22267190","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,1]]},"page":"252-274","publisher":"Spring Media","title":"Ultrasound elastography","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"currieRemodeling99mTcPertechnetate2022","abstract":"Although reference ranges for 99mTc thyroid percentage uptake vary, the seemingly intuitive evaluation of thyroid function does not reflect the complexity of thyroid pathology and biochemical status. The emergence of artificial intelligence in nuclear medicine has driven problem solving associated with logic and reasoning, warranting reexamination of established benchmarks in thyroid functional assessment. Methods: This retrospective study of 123 patients compared scintigraphic findings with grounded truth established through biochemistry status. Conventional statistical approaches were used in conjunction with an artificial neural network to determine predictors of thyroid function from data features. A convolutional neural network was also used to extract features from the input tensor (images). Results: Analysis was confounded by subclinical hyperthyroidism, primary hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and triiodothyronine toxicosis. Binary accuracy for identifying hyperthyroidism was highest for thyroid uptake classification using a threshold of 4.5% (82.6%), followed by pooled physician interpretation with the aid of uptake values (82.3%). Visual evaluation without quantitative values reduced accuracy to 61.0% for pooled physician determinations and 61.4% classifying on the basis of thyroid gland intensity relative to salivary glands. The machine learning (ML) algorithm produced 84.6% accuracy; however, this included biochemistry features not available to the semantic analysis. The deep learning (DL) algorithm had an accuracy of 80.5% based on image inputs alone. Conclusion: Thyroid scintigraphy is useful in identifying hyperthyroid patients suitable for radioiodine therapy when using an appropriately validated cutoff for the patient population (4.5% in this population). ML artificial neural network algorithms can be developed to improve accuracy as second-reader systems when biochemistry results are available. DL convolutional neural network algorithms can be developed to improve accuracy in the absence of biochemistry results. ML and DL do not displace the role of the physician in thyroid scintigraphy but can be used as second-reader systems to minimize errors and increase confidence.","author":[{"family":"Currie","given":"Geoffrey M."},{"family":"Iqbal","given":"Basit"}],"citation-key":"currieRemodeling99mTcPertechnetate2022","container-title":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology","DOI":"10.2967/jnmt.121.263081","ISSN":"0091-4916","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"page":"143-152","publisher":"Society of Nuclear Medicine Inc.","title":"Remodeling <sup>99m</sup> Tc-Pertechnetate Thyroid Uptake: Statistical, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Approaches","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://tech.snmjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.2967/jnmt.121.263081","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"daiClinicopathologicalFeaturesPrognostic2023","abstract":"Purpose: To investigate the clinicopathological features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of multiple synchronous distinct subtypes of primary thyroid carcinomas. Methods: The clinical data of 68 cases of synchronous carcinomas of the thyroid (STC) admitted to the Department of Thyroid Surgery in our hospital from January 2013 to December 2021 were reviewed. According to the pathological type, they were divided into the Synchronous differentiated and differentiated thyroid Carcinoma (SDDTC) group (42 cases), the Synchronous medullary and differentiated thyroid Carcinoma (SMDTC) group (18 cases), and the Synchronous Anaplastic and differentiated thyroid Carcinoma (SADTC)group (8 cases). The diagnosis, treatment, and survival of patients in each group were analyzed. Results: Women with coexisting thyroid cancer were predominant (59 cases). Most of the symptoms were found on physical examination (47.1%) and neck mass (45.6%). The median age of patients in the SDDTC group, SADTC group, and SMDTC group was 47.5 (28–74) years old, 68.5 (26–75) years old, and 56.5 (39–74) years old. The age of the SADTC group and SMDTC group was older than that of the SDDTC group (P = 0.04, P = 0.03), and the rate of lymph node metastasis in groups SADTC (62.5%) and SMDTC (55.6%) was higher than in group SDDTC (21.4%). The disease course time, tumor location, clinical stage, and mortality of the SADTC group were significantly different from those of the SDDTC group and SMDTC group (P < 0.05). The overall survival of patients with synchronous carcinomas of the thyroid was 6–105 months, and the median overall survival was 38.5 months. The tumor-free survival was 0–90 months, 19.1% of patients developed distant metastasis, 11.8% of patients had postoperative recurrence, as well as the survival rate was estimated 91.18%. Cox model multivariate analysis showed that cervical lateral lymph node metastasis and tumor stage III/IV were independent risk factors for progression-free survival(PFS). The comparison results of the survival curves showed that the overall survival (OS)of the patients in the SADTC group was significantly worse (P < 0.01), while there was no significant difference in the PFS of different pathological types (χ2 = 5.024, P = 0.081).The OS of different treatment methods was significantly different (P = 0.002), but there was no significant difference in OS between local recurrence and distant metastases with or without surgery (χ2 = 0.954, P = 0.329). Conclusions: The STC has relatively unique clinical characteristics, and most patients can get a better prognosis after radical surgery. Pathological type, lateral cervical lymph node metastasis, tumor stage, and treatment are important factors which affect the prognosis of the disease. Since there are two distinct tumors with different aggressiveness, treatment options, and prognosis, individualized management is required.","author":[{"family":"Dai","given":"Quanwei"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Xinghao"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Yalei"},{"family":"He","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Xinguang"}],"citation-key":"daiClinicopathologicalFeaturesPrognostic2023","container-title":"Endocrine","DOI":"10.1007/s12020-022-03243-0","ISSN":"15590100","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,1]]},"page":"491-501","PMID":"36399310","publisher":"Springer","title":"Clinicopathological features and prognostic factors analysis of multiple synchronous distinct subtypes of primary thyroid carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"79"},

We aimed to evaluate the performance of two machine learning methods (ML), based on routinely available features to predict the risk of malignancy (RM) of ITN. Design: Multi-centric diagnostic retrospective cohort study conducted between 2010 and 2020. Methods: Adult patients who underwent surgery for at least one Bethesda III-V thyroid nodule (TN) with fully available medical records were included. Of the 7917 records reviewed, eligibility criteria were met in 1288 patients with 1335 TN. Patients were divided into training (940 TN) and validation cohort (395 TN). The diagnostic performance of a multivariate logistic regression model (LR) and its nomogram, and a random forest model (RF) in predicting the nature and RM of a TN were evaluated. All available clinical, biological, ultrasound, and cytological data of the patients were collected and used to construct the two algorithms. Results: There were 253 (19%), 693 (52%), and 389 (29%) TN classified as Bethesda III, IV, and V, respectively, with an overall RM of 35%. Both cohorts were well-balanced for baseline characteristics.

  {"id":"dasDataAugmentedBayesian2021","abstract":"Failures in optical network backbone can cause significant interruption in internet data traffic. Hence, it is very important to reduce such network outages. Prediction of such failures would be a step forward to avoid such disruption of internet services for users as well as operators. Several research proposals are available in the literature which are applications of data science and machine learning techniques. Most of the techniques rely on significant amount of real time data collection. Network devices are assumed to be equipped to collect data and these are then analysed by different algorithms to predict failures. Every network element which is already deployed in the field may not have these data gathering or analysis techniques designed into them initially. However, such mechanisms become necessary later when they are already deployed in the field.

  {"id":"dekosterQuantitativeClassificationRadiomics2022","abstract":"Purpose: To evaluate whether quantitative [18F]FDG-PET/CT assessment, including radiomic analysis of [18F]FDG-positive thyroid nodules, improved the preoperative differentiation of indeterminate thyroid nodules of non-Hürthle cell and Hürthle cell cytology. Methods: Prospectively included patients with a Bethesda III or IV thyroid nodule underwent [18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for standardised uptake values (SUV) and SUV-ratios, including assessment of SUV cut-offs at which a malignant/borderline neoplasm was reliably ruled out (≥ 95% sensitivity). [18F]FDG-positive scans were included in radiomic analysis. After segmentation at 50% of SUVpeak, 107 radiomic features were extracted from [18F]FDG-PET and low-dose CT images. Elastic net regression classifiers were trained in a 20-times repeated random split. Dimensionality reduction was incorporated into the splits. Predictive performance of radiomics was presented as mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) across the test sets. Results: Of 123 included patients, 84 (68%) index nodules were visually [18F]FDG-positive. The malignant/borderline rate was 27% (33/123). SUV-metrices showed AUCs ranging from 0.705 (95% CI, 0.601–0.810) to 0.729 (0.633–0.824), 0.708 (0.580–0.835) to 0.757 (0.650–0.864), and 0.533 (0.320–0.747) to 0.700 (0.502–0.898) in all (n = 123), non-Hürthle (n = 94), and Hürthle cell (n = 29) nodules, respectively. At SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmax-ratio, and SUVpeak-ratio cut-offs of 2.1 g/mL, 1.6 g/mL, 1.2, and 0.9, respectively, sensitivity of [18F]FDG-PET/CT was 95.8% (95% CI, 78.9–99.9%) in non-Hürthle cell nodules. In Hürthle cell nodules, cut-offs of 5.2 g/mL, 4.7 g/mL, 3.4, and 2.8, respectively, resulted in 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 66.4–100%). Radiomic analysis of 84 (68%) [18F]FDG-positive nodules showed a mean test set AUC of 0.445 (95% CI, 0.290–0.600) for the PET model. Conclusion: Quantitative [18F]FDG-PET/CT assessment ruled out malignancy in indeterminate thyroid nodules. Distinctive, higher SUV cut-offs should be applied in Hürthle cell nodules to optimize rule-out ability. Radiomic analysis did not contribute to the additional differentiation of [18F]FDG-positive nodules.

  {"id":"dhimanExplainableAIBased2024","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel framework for breast cancer classification using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. As the incidence of breast cancer in India continues to rise, early detection is essential for increasing survival rates. For precise classification, an efficient classifier model is required. Due to the variety of datasets and performance metrics, a single classifier may not be sufficient. Thus, we propose an efficient ensemble classifier based on Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) integrated with the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA). TOPSIS, a technique for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), ranks and selects the ensemble's base classifiers. The CSA fine-tunes the weights of the base classifiers. In addition, we employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to visualize feature attributions at the observation level, thereby facilitating model interpretation and comprehension. The proposed classifier performs admirably on the experimental testing dataset, with values of 0.921, 0.921, 0.923, 0.921, 0.846 and 0.846 for precision, recall, F1-score, Kappa, and MCC, respectively.

Consequently, it is required for normal body physiology but is also involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases, most notably cancer. The important role of tumor-associated lymphatic vessels and lymphangiogenesis in the formation of lymph node metastasis has been elucidated during the last two decades, whereas the underlying mechanisms and the relation between lymphatic and peripheral organ dissemination of cancer cells are incompletely understood. Lymphatic vessels are also important for tumor-host communication, relaying molecular information from a primary or metastatic tumor to regional lymph nodes and the circulatory system. Beyond antigen transport, lymphatic endothelial cells, particularly those residing in lymph node sinuses, have recently been recognized as direct regulators of tumor immunity and immunotherapy responsiveness, presenting tumor antigens and expressing several immune-modulatory signals including PD-L1. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries in this rapidly evolving field and highlight strategies and challenges of therapeutic targeting of lymphatic vessels or specific lymphatic functions in cancer patients.","author":[{"family":"Dieterich","given":"Lothar C."},{"family":"Tacconi","given":"Carlotta"},{"family":"Ducoli","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Detmar","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"dieterichLYMPHATICVESSELSCANCER2022","container-title":"Physiological Reviews","DOI":"10.1152/physrev.00039.2021","ISSN":"15221210","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,1]]},"page":"1837-1879","PMID":"35771983","publisher":"American Physiological Society","title":"LYMPHATIC VESSELS IN CANCER","type":"article-journal","volume":"102"},

  {"id":"duanMachineLearningbasedPrediction2024","abstract":"Background: Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women. Advanced breast cancer can develop distant metastases, posing a severe threat to the life of patients. Because the clinical warning signs of distant metastasis are manifested in the late stage of the disease, there is a need for better methods of predicting metastasis. Methods: First, we screened breast cancer distant metastasis target genes by performing difference analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the selected datasets, and performed analyses such as GO enrichment analysis on these target genes. Secondly, we screened breast cancer distant metastasis target genes by LASSO regression analysis and performed correlation analysis and other analyses on these biomarkers. Finally, we constructed several breast cancer distant metastasis prediction models based on Logistic Regression (LR) model, Random Forest (RF) model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) model and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, and selected the optimal model from them. Results: Several 21-gene breast cancer distant metastasis prediction models were constructed, with the best performance of the model constructed based on the random forest model. This model accurately predicted the emergence of distant metastases from breast cancer, with an accuracy of 93.6 %, an F1-score of 88.9 % and an AUC value of 91.3 % on the validation set.

  {"id":"eliseiBRAFV600EMutationOutcome2008","abstract":"Background: The BRAFV600E mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The role of BRAF V600E mutation as a poor prognostic factor has been controversially reported in series with short-term follow-ups. In this study we verified the prognostic value of the BRAFV600E mutation in PTC patients with a long-term follow-up. Methods: We studied 102 PTC patients with a median follow-up of 15 yr. The BRAFV600E mutation was analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. The correlation between the presence/absence of the BRAFV600E mutation, clinicopathological features, and outcome of PTC patients were evaluated. Results: The BRAFV600E mutation was found in 38 of 102 (37.3%) PTC patients, and was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 yr (P = 0.02), in advanced stages (P = 0.03), and in cases with vascular invasion (P = 0.02). At univariate analysis the worst outcome for PTC patients was significantly correlated with clinicopathological features (i.e. age, tumor size, extrathyroid extension, lymph node and distant metastases, advanced stage, vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and vascular invasion) and the BRAFV600E mutation (P < 0.002). However, at multivariate analysis only the BRAFV600E mutation showed an independent correlation with the worst outcome (P = 0.03). Moreover, the survival curves of PTC patients showed a lower percentage of survivors in the BRAFV600E-mutated group (P = 0.015). Conclusions: In this study the BRAFV600E mutation correlated with the worst outcome for PTC patients, who were not only at a higher risk not to be cured but also for death. In particular, the BRAF V600E mutation was demonstrated to be a poor prognostic factor independent from other clinicopathological features.

  {"id":"elizarReviewMultiscaleDeepLearningApplications2022","abstract":"In general, most of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep-learning models suffer from spatial-information loss and inadequate feature-representation issues. This is due to their inability to capture multiscale-context information and the exclusion of semantic information throughout the pooling operations. In the early layers of a CNN, the network encodes simple semantic representations, such as edges and corners, while, in the latter part of the CNN, the network encodes more complex semantic features, such as complex geometric shapes. Theoretically, it is better for a CNN to extract features from different levels of semantic representation because tasks such as classification and segmentation work better when both simple and complex feature maps are utilized. Hence, it is also crucial to embed multiscale capability throughout the network so that the various scales of the features can be optimally captured to represent the intended task. Multiscale representation enables the network to fuse low-level and high-level features from a restricted receptive field to enhance the deep-model performance. The main novelty of this review is the comprehensive novel taxonomy of multiscale-deep-learning methods, which includes details of several architectures and their strengths that have been implemented in the existing works. Predominantly, multiscale approaches in deep-learning networks can be classed into two categories: multiscale feature learning and multiscale feature fusion. Multiscale feature learning refers to the method of deriving feature maps by examining kernels over several sizes to collect a larger range of relevant features and predict the input images’ spatial mapping. Multiscale feature fusion uses features with different resolutions to find patterns over short and long distances, without a deep network. Additionally, several examples of the techniques are also discussed according to their applications in satellite imagery, medical imaging, agriculture, and industrial and manufacturing systems.","author":[{"family":"Elizar","given":"Elizar"},{"family":"Zulkifley","given":"Mohd Asyraf"},{"family":"Muharar","given":"Rusdha"},{"family":"Zaman","given":"Mohd Hairi Mohd"},{"family":"Mustaza","given":"Seri Mastura"}],"citation-key":"elizarReviewMultiscaleDeepLearningApplications2022","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s22197384","ISSN":"14248220","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,1]]},"PMID":"36236483","publisher":"MDPI","title":"A Review on Multiscale-Deep-Learning Applications","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

Although the prognosis of thyroid cancer patients is generally favorable, the prognosis of patients with intracranial metastases from thyroid cancer has been considered unfavorable owing to lower survival rates among such patients compared to those without intracranial involvement. Many questions about their management remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyze the characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes of patients with brain metastases from thyroid cancer. Among 4320 patients with thyroid cancer recorded in our institutional database over a 30-year period, the data of 20 patients with brain metastasis were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The clinical characteristics, histological type of primary cancer and metastatic brain tumor, additional previous distant metastasis, treatment modalities, locations and characteristics on radiologic findings, time interval between the first diagnosis of primary thyroid cancer and brain metastasis, and survival were analyzed. Among our patient cohort, the mean age at initial diagnosis was 59.3 ± 14.1 years, and at the manifestation of diagnosis of cerebral metastasis, the mean age was found to be 64.8 ± 14.9 years. The histological types of primary thyroid cancer were identified as papillary in ten patients, follicular in seven, and poorly differentiated carcinoma in three. The average interval between the diagnosis of thyroid cancer and brain metastasis was 63.4 ± 58.4 months (range: 0–180 months). Ten patients were identified as having a single intracranial lesion, and ten patients were found to have multiple lesions. Surgical resection was primarily performed in fifteen patients, and whole-brain radiotherapy, radiotherapy, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors were applied in the remaining five patients. The overall median survival time was 15 months after the diagnosis of BMs from TC (range: 1–252 months). Patients with thyroid cancer can develop brain metastasis even many years after the diagnosis of the primary tumor. The results of our study demonstrate increased overall survival in patients younger than 60 years of age at the time of diagnosis of brain metastasis. There was no difference in survival between patients with brain metastasis from papillary carcinoma and those with follicular thyroid carcinoma.</p>","author":[{"family":"Esmaeilzadeh","given":"Majid"},{"family":"Atallah","given":"Oday"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jörg Andreas"},{"family":"Bengel","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Polemikos","given":"Manolis"},{"family":"Heissler","given":"Hans E."},{"family":"Krauss","given":"Joachim K."}],"citation-key":"esmaeilzadehBrainMetastasesThyroid2024","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers16132371","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,28]]},"page":"2371","title":"Brain Metastases from Thyroid Carcinoma: Prognostic Factors and Outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/13/2371","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"essermanAddressingOverdiagnosisOvertreatment2014","abstract":"A vast range of disorders-from indolent to fast-growing lesions-are labelled as cancer. Therefore, we believe that several changes should be made to the approach to cancer screening and care, such as use of new terminology for indolent and precancerous disorders. We propose the term indolent lesion of epithelial origin, or IDLE, for those lesions (currently labelled as cancers) and their precursors that are unlikely to cause harm if they are left untreated. Furthermore, precursors of cancer or high-risk disorders should not have the term cancer in them. The rationale for this change in approach is that indolent lesions with low malignant potential are common, and screening brings indolent lesions and their precursors to clinical attention, which leads to overdiagnosis and, if unrecognised, possible overtreatment. To minimise that potential, new strategies should be adopted to better define and manage IDLEs. Screening guidelines should be revised to lower the chance of detection of minimal-risk IDLEs and inconsequential cancers with the same energy traditionally used to increase the sensitivity of screening tests. Changing the terminology for some of the lesions currently referred to as cancer will allow physicians to shift medicolegal notions and perceived risk to reflect the evolving understanding of biology, be more judicious about when a biopsy should be done, and organise studies and registries that offer observation or less invasive approaches for indolent disease. Emphasis on avoidance of harm while assuring benefit will improve screening and treatment of patients and will be equally effective in the prevention of death from cancer. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Esserman","given":"Laura J."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Ian M."},{"family":"Reid","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Ransohoff","given":"David F."},{"family":"Welch","given":"H.

  {"id":"fanBibliometricAnalysisFollicular2024","abstract":"Background: Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), the second most prevalent thyroid cancer after papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), tends to metastasize distantly, leading to poorer outcomes. Despite substantial research, a holistic bibliometric analysis of FTC literature is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by employing bibliometric methods to track FTC research evolution. Methods: English FTC publications were systematically gathered from the Web of Science. Bibliometric analysis, using R, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Excel, synthesized data and explored global research trends and topics. Results: From 2000 to 2023, 9086 authors from 1953 institutions across 75 countries contributed to 1776 papers in 491 academic journals on FTC. The last two decades have witnessed a steady increase in publications related to FTC, with the United States leading in terms of publication volume. The United States dominated both in publications and citations, with the National Cancer Institute and Sheue-Yann Cheng as leading contributors. The journal 'Thyroid' featured the most publications, while the 'Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism' ranked highest in citation frequency. Research focused on gene expression analysis and preoperative diagnostics, with recent trends shifting toward prognosis management and machine learning due to advances in medical technology and increased health awareness. Conclusion: This comprehensive bibliometric analysis has mapped the landscape of FTC research, highlighting key contributors, institutions, and thematic trends. Current discourse predominantly revolves around genetic analysis, prognostic determinants, and preoperative diagnostics in FTC. This foundational work guides future FTC research, providing insights into its evolution.","author":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Yuanyuan"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Xun"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Tianfeng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Pengyu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yujie"},{"family":"Ran","given":"Yanhao"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Tao"}],"citation-key":"fanBibliometricAnalysisFollicular2024","container-title":"Asian Journal of Surgery","DOI":"10.1016/j.asjsur.2024.07.271","ISSN":"02193108","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"publisher":"Elsevier (Singapore) Pte Ltd","title":"A bibliometric analysis of follicular thyroid carcinoma: Current situation, hot spots, and global trends","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"fengValueUltrasoundGrayscale2022","abstract":"Objective: The value of ultrasound grayscale ratio (UGSR) in the diagnosis of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) and benign micronodules (BMNs) has been recognized by some authors, but studies have not examined these aspects in patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT). This retrospective study investigated the value of UGSR in the diagnosis of PTMCs and BMNs in patients with HT using data from two medical centers. Methods: Ultrasound images of 428 PTMCs in 368 patients with HT and 225 BMNs in 181 patients with HT in center A were retrospectively analyzed and compared to the ultrasound images of 412 PTMCs in 324 patients with HT and 315 BMNs in 229 patients with HT in medical center B. All of the cases were surgically confirmed. The UGSR was calculated as the ratio of the grayscale value of lesions to the surrounding normal thyroid tissues. The optimal UGSR thresholds for the PTMCs and BMNs in patients with HT from the two medical centers were determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Furthermore, other statistics, including the area under the curve (AUC), the optimal UGSR threshold, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy of the two medical centers, were pair analyzed in this study. Results: The UGSR of PTMCs and BMNs in patients with HT from medical center A were 0.513 (0.442, 0.592) and 0.857 (0.677, 0.977) (Z = −15.564, p = 0), and those from medical center B were 0.514 (0.431, 0.625) and 0.917 (0.705, 1.131) (Z = −15.564, p = 0). For both medical centers A and B, the AUC, optimal UGSR threshold, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of the UGSR in differentiating between PTMCs and BMNs in patients with HT were 0.870 and 0.889, 0.68 and 0.70, 0.921 and 0.898, 0.747 and 0.759, 0.874 and 0.829, 0.832 and 0.848, and 0.861 and 0.836, respectively. There were no significant differences in the UGSR for the PTMCs between patients from the two medical centers (Z = −0.815, p = 0.415), while there was a significant difference in the UGSR of the BMNs between patients from the two medical centers (Z = −3.637, p = 0). Conclusion: In the context of HT, UGSR still has high sensitivity, accuracy, and stability in differentiating between PTMCs and BMNs, making it a complementary differentiator of thyroid imaging reporting and data systems. However, due to its low specificity, a comprehensive analysis of other ultrasound signs is required.","author":[{"family":"Feng","given":"Na"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Peiying"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Xiangkai"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Jincao"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Fang"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Di"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liping"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Han","given":"Zhijiang"}],"citation-key":"fengValueUltrasoundGrayscale2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2022.949847","ISSN":"16642392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,12]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"The value of ultrasound grayscale ratio in the diagnosis of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas and benign micronodules in patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: A two-center controlled study","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Since discordant data on the clinico-pathologic features of B-RAF mutated PTC are present in the literature, the aim of the present co-operative study was to establish the prevalence of this genetic alteration and to perform a genotype-phenotype correlation in a large cohort of patients with PTC. To this purpose, a series of 260 sporadic PTCs with different histological variants were included in the study. The mutational analysis of the B-RAF gene was performed either by RT-PCR followed by single-stranded conformational polymorphism or by PCR and direct sequencing. Statistical analyses were obtained by means of χ2/ Fisher's exact test and t-test. Overall, a heterozygous T>A transversion at nucleotide 1799 (V600E) was found in 99 out of 260 PTCs (38%). According to the histological type of the tumor, the B-RAFV600E mutation was present in 48.3% of cases of classic PTCs (85 out of 176), in 17.6% (nine out of 51) of follicular variants of PTCs, in 21.7% (five out of 23) in other PTC variants and in none of the ten poorly differentiated tumors. B-RAFV600E was significantly associated with the classic variant of PTC (P = 0.0001) and with an older age at diagnosis (P = 0.01). No statistically significant correlation was found among the presence of B-RAFV600E and gender, tumor node metastasis (TNM), multicentricity of the tumor, stage at diagnosis and outcome. In conclusion, the present study reports the prevalence of B-RAFV600E (38%) in the largest series of sporadic PTCs, including 260 cases from three different Italian referring centers.

  {"id":"fuPTCMASDeepLearningBased2023","abstract":"Background: Identifying cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in primary thyroid cancer preoperatively using ultrasound is challenging. Therefore, a non-invasive method is needed to assess LNM accurately. Purpose: To address this need, we developed the Primary Thyroid Cancer Lymph Node Metastasis Assessment System (PTC-MAS), a transfer learning-based and B-mode ultrasound images-based automatic assessment system for assessing LNM in primary thyroid cancer. Methods: The system has two parts: YOLO Thyroid Nodule Recognition System (YOLOS) for obtaining regions of interest (ROIs) of nodules, and LMM assessment system for building the LNM assessment system using transfer learning and majority voting with extracted ROIs as input. We retained the relative size features of nodules to improve the system’s performance. Results: We evaluated three transfer learning-based neural networks (DenseNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet) and majority voting, which had the area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.802, 0.837, 0.823, and 0.858, respectively. Method III preserved relative size features and achieved higher AUCs than Method II, which fixed nodule size. YOLOS achieved high precision and sensitivity on a test set, indicating its potential for ROIs extraction. Conclusions: Our proposed PTC-MAS system effectively assesses primary thyroid cancer LNM based on preserving nodule relative size features. It has potential for guiding treatment modalities and avoiding inaccurate ultrasound results due to tracheal interference.","author":[{"family":"Fu","given":"Ruqian"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Dezhi"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Shuhan"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhijie"},{"family":"Teng","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Jianli"}],"citation-key":"fuPTCMASDeepLearningBased2023","container-title":"Diagnostics","DOI":"10.3390/diagnostics13101723","ISSN":"20754418","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","title":"PTC-MAS: A Deep Learning-Based Preoperative Automatic Assessment of Lymph Node Metastasis in Primary Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

The prevalence of thyroid disorders increases with age and numerous morphological and physiological changes of the thyroid gland during the process of aging are well-known.

  {"id":"giovanellaIntegratedDiagnosticsThyroid2024","abstract":"Thyroid nodules are common findings, particularly in iodine-deficient regions. Our paper aims to revise different diagnostic tools available in clinical thyroidology and propose their rational integration. We will elaborate on the pros and cons of thyroid ultrasound (US) and its scoring systems, thyroid scintigraphy, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), molecular imaging, and artificial intelligence (AI). Ultrasonographic scoring systems can help differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. Depending on the constellation or number of suspicious ultrasound features, a FNAC is recommended. However, hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules are presumed to exclude malignancy with a very high negative predictive value (NPV). Particularly in regions where iodine supply is low, most hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules are seen in patients with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Thyroid scintigraphy is essential for the detection of these nodules. Among non-toxic thyroid nodules, a careful application of US risk stratification systems is pivotal to exclude inappropriate FNAC and guide the procedure on suspicious ones. However, almost one-third of cytology examinations are rendered as indeterminate, requiring “diagnostic surgery” to provide a definitive diagnosis. 99mTc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile ([99mTc]Tc-MIBI) and [18F]fluoro-deoxy-glucose ([18F]FDG) molecular imaging can spare those patients from unnecessary surgeries.

We evaluated the ability of PET metrics and radiomics features (RFs) to predict final diagnosis of 18FDG-avid cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. Methods: Seventy-eight patients were retrospectively included. After volumetric segmentation of each thyroid lesion, 4 PET metrics and 107 RFs were extracted. A logistic regression was performed including thyroid stimulating hormone, PET metrics, and RFs to assess their predictive performance. A linear combination of the resulting parameters generated a radiomics score (RS) that was matched with cytology classes (Bethesda III and IV) and compared with final diagnosis. Results: Two RFs (shape_Sphericity and glcm_Autocorrelation) differentiated malignant from benign lesions. A predictive model integrating RS and cytology classes effectively stratified the risk of malignancy. The prevalence of thyroid cancer increased from 5 to 37% and 79% in accordance with the number (score 0, 1 or 2, respectively) of positive biomarkers.

  {"id":"gongControlCellularDifferentiation2024","abstract":"Cellular differentiation is controlled by intricate layers of gene regulation, involving the modulation of gene expression by various transcriptional regulators. Due to the complexity of gene regulation, identifying master regulators across the differentiation trajectory has been a longstanding challenge. To tackle this problem, a computational framework, single-cell Boolean network inference and control (BENEIN), is presented. Applying BENEIN to human large intestinal single-cell transcriptome data, MYB, HDAC2, and FOXA2 are identified as the master regulators whose inhibition induces enterocyte differentiation. It is found that simultaneous knockdown of these master regulators can revert colorectal cancer cells into normal-like enterocytes by synergistically inducing differentiation and suppressing malignancy, which is validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments.","author":[{"family":"Gong","given":"Jeong Ryeol"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Chun Kyung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hoon Min"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Juhee"},{"family":"Jeon","given":"Jaeog"},{"family":"Park","given":"Sunmin"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Kwang Hyun"}],"citation-key":"gongControlCellularDifferentiation2024","container-title":"Advanced Science","DOI":"10.1002/advs.202402132","ISSN":"21983844","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,20]]},"publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc","title":"Control of Cellular Differentiation Trajectories for Cancer Reversion","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"gongInvestigatingDiagnosticEfficiency2023","abstract":"Objectives: This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system in distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules in the context of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and to evaluate the role of the CAD system in reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Methods: We included a total of 137 nodules from 137 consecutive patients (mean age, 43.5 ± 11.8 years) who were histopathologically diagnosed with HT. The two-dimensional ultrasound images and videos of all thyroid nodules were analyzed by the CAD system and two radiologists with different experiences according to ACR TI-RADS. The diagnostic cutoff values of ACR TI-RADS were divided into two categories (TR4 and TR5), and then the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the CAD system and the junior and senior radiologists were compared in both cases. Moreover, ACR TI-RADS classification was revised according to the results of the CAD system, and the efficacy of recommended fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was evaluated by comparing the unnecessary biopsy rate and the malignant rate of punctured nodules. Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the CAD system were 0.876, 0.905, 0.830, 0.894, and 0.846, respectively. With TR4 as the cutoff value, the AUCs of the CAD system and the junior and senior radiologists were 0.867, 0.628, and 0.722, respectively, and the CAD system had the highest AUC (P < 0.0001). With TR5 as the cutoff value, the AUCs of the CAD system and the junior and senior radiologists were 0.867, 0.654, and 0.812, respectively, and the CAD system had a higher AUC than the junior radiologist (P < 0.0001) but comparable to the senior radiologist (P = 0.0709). With the assistance of the CAD system, the number of TR4 nodules was decreased by both junior and senior radiologists, the malignant rate of punctured nodules increased by 30% and 22%, and the unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions were both reduced by nearly half. Conclusions: The CAD system based on deep learning can improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists in identifying benign and malignant thyroid nodules in the context of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and can play a role in FNA recommendations to reduce unnecessary biopsy rates.","author":[{"family":"Gong","given":"Liu"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jia Le"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wen Gang"}],"citation-key":"gongInvestigatingDiagnosticEfficiency2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.941673","ISSN":"2234943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,5]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Investigating the diagnostic efficiency of a computer-aided diagnosis system for thyroid nodules in the context of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"gongThyroidRegionPrior2022","abstract":"Ultrasound segmentation of thyroid nodules is a challenging task, which plays an vital role in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. However, the following two factors limit the development of automatic thyroid nodule segmentation algorithms: (1) existing automatic nodule segmentation algorithms that directly apply semantic segmentation techniques can easily mistake non-thyroid areas as nodules, because of the lack of the thyroid gland region perception, the large number of similar areas in the ultrasonic images, and the inherently low contrast images; (2) the currently available dataset (i.e., DDTI) is small and collected from a single center, which violates the fact that thyroid ultrasound images are acquired from various devices in real-world situations. To overcome the lack of thyroid gland region prior knowledge, we design a thyroid region prior guided feature enhancement network (TRFE+) for accurate thyroid nodule segmentation. Specifically, (1) a novel multi-task learning framework that simultaneously learns the nodule size, gland position, and the nodule position is designed; (2) an adaptive gland region feature enhancement module is proposed to make full use of the thyroid gland prior knowledge; (3) a normalization approach with respect to the channel dimension is applied to alleviate the domain gap during the training process. To facilitate the development of thyroid nodule segmentation, we have contributed TN3K: an open-access dataset containing 3493 thyroid nodule images with high-quality nodule masks labeling from various devices and views. We perform a thorough evaluation based on the TN3K test set and DDTI to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  {"id":"graniReducingNumberUnnecessary2019","abstract":"Context: The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is increasingly high, and at least half of those biopsied prove to be benign. Sonographic risk-stratification systems are being proposed as “rule-out” tests that can identify nodules that do not require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. Objective: To comparatively assess the performances of five internationally endorsed sonographic classification systems [those of the American Thyroid Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American College of Radiology (ACR), the European Thyroid Association, and the Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology] in identifying nodules whose FNAs can be safely deferred and to estimate their negative predictive values (NPVs). Design: Prospective study of thyroid nodules referred for FNA. Setting: Single academic referral center. Patients: Four hundred seventy-seven patients (358 females, 75.2%); mean (SD) age, 55.9 (13.9) years. Main Outcome Measures: Number of biopsies classified as unnecessary, false-negative rate (FNR), sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and diagnostic ORs for each system. Results: Application of the systems’ FNA criteria would have reduced the number of biopsies performed by 17.1% to 53.4%. The ACR Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) allowed the largest reduction (268 of 502) with the lowest FNR (NPV, 97.8%; 95% CI, 95.2% to 99.2%). Except for the Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology TIRADS, all other systems exhibited significant discriminatory performance but produced significantly smaller reductions in the number of procedures. Conclusions: Internationally endorsed sonographic risk stratification systems vary widely in their ability to reduce the number of unnecessary thyroid nodule FNAs.

  {"id":"guComparisonSonographicCharacteristics2017","abstract":"Background: Although primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) both account for a rare portion of the morbidity of all thyroid malignancies, the therapeutic methods and prognosis for these two diseases are different. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sonographic characteristics of PTL and ATC and to compare the sonographic findings of PTL and ATC. Methods: The study included 42 patients with histopathologically proven PTL (n=27) and ATC (n=15). The Clinical characteristics and sonographic findings were retrospectively reviewed and compared between the two groups. Results: The mean age of patients with ATC was not significantly different from that in patients with PTL (P=0.601). The female-to-male ratio of patients with ATC was significantly lower than that of patients with PTL (P=0.029). Both PTL and ATC commonly present as a relatively large, solid mass on sonography with compressive symptoms, in which hoarseness was seen more frequently in ATC group (66.7%) than in PTL group (14.8%) (P=0.001). There is no significant difference in thyroid size, nodular size, margin, shape, echo texture, echogenicity, cystic change, vascularity and local invasion on sonography between ATC and PTL groups. Echogenic strands, markedly hypoechoic and enhanced posterior echo were seen more frequently in PTL group (92.6%, 92.6%, and 85.2%, respectively) than those in ATC group (6.7%, 60.0%, and 33.3%, respectively) (P < 0.05), and calcification was seen more frequently in ATC group (80.0%) than in PTL group (0%) (P < 0.001). Three ultrasound patterns were observed for PTL including diffuse type (25.9%), nodular type (48.2%) and mixed type (25.9%), while all ATC cases presented with nodular type (100.0%). Associated Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurred more frequently in PTL group (59.3%) than in ATC group (20.0%) (P=0.023). Conclusions: Certain sonographic features as a markedly hypoechogenicity, the presence of an enhanced posterior echo and linear echogenic strands, lack of calcification and associated Hashimoto's thyroiditis were valuable for distinguishing PTL from ATC. In contrast, heterogeneous echogenicity, uncircumscribed margin, irregular shape, and vascular pattern were not specific features for differential diagnosis.","author":[{"family":"Gu","given":"Li Shuang"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Ning Yi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Che","given":"Shu Nan"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Shuang Mei"},{"family":"He","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jun Ying"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Xuan Tong"}],"citation-key":"guComparisonSonographicCharacteristics2017","container-title":"Journal of Thoracic Disease","DOI":"10.21037/jtd.2017.09.48","ISSN":"20776624","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,1]]},"page":"4774-4784","publisher":"AME Publishing Company","title":"Comparison of sonographic characteristics of primary thyroid lymphoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"guMachineLearningbasedApproach2022","abstract":"Background: Thyroid Cancer (TC) is the most common malignant disease of endocrine system, and its incidence rate is increasing year by year. Early diagnosis, management of malignant nodules and scientific treatment are crucial for TC prognosis. The first aim is the construction of a classification model for TC based on risk factors. The second aim is the construction of a prediction model for metastasis based on risk factors. Methods: We retrospectively collected approximately 70 preoperative demographic and laboratory test indices from 1735 TC patients. Machine learning pipelines including linear regression model ridge, Logistic Regression (LR) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to select the best model for predicting deterioration and metastasis of TC. A comprehensive comparative analysis with the prediction model using only thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS). Results: The XGBoost model achieved the best performance in the final thyroid nodule diagnosis (AUC: 0.84) and metastasis (AUC: 0.72-0.77) predictions. Its AUCs for predicting Grade 4 TC deterioration and metastasis reached 0.84 and 0.97, respectively, while none of the AUCs for Only TI-RADS reached 0.70. Based on multivariate analysis and feature selection, age, obesity, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, and HBeAb were common significant risk factors for tumor progression and metastasis. Monocyte, D-dimer, T3, FT3, and albumin were common protective factors. Tumor size (11.14 ± 7.14 mm) is the most important indicator of metastasis formation. In addition, GGT, glucose, platelet volume distribution width, and neutrophil percentage also contributed to the development of metastases. The abnormal levels of blood lipid and uric acid were closely related to the deterioration of tumor. The dual role of mean erythrocytic hemoglobin concentration in TC needs to be verified in a larger patient cohort. We have established a free online tool (http://www.cancer-thyroid.com/) that is available to all clinicians for the prognosis of patients at high risk of TC. Conclusion: It is feasible to use XGBoost algorithm, combined with preoperative laboratory test indexes and demographic characteristics to predict tumor progression and metastasis in patients with TC, and its performance is better than that of Only using TI-RADS. The web tools we developed can help physicians with less clinical experience to choose the appropriate clinical decision or secondary confirmation of diagnosis results.","author":[{"family":"Gu","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Rongli"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yanna"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zhifeng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Min"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tingyu"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Wenjuan"},{"family":"Nie","given":"Zihuai"},{"family":"Miao","given":"Enjun"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Sibo"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Dongjie"},{"family":"Fei","given":"Jian"}],"citation-key":"guMachineLearningbasedApproach2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.938292","ISSN":"2234943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,19]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"A machine learning-based approach to predicting the malignant and metastasis of thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"guoClassificationDiagnosisResidual2021","abstract":"Patients with thyroid cancer will take a small dose of 131I after undergoing a total thyroidectomy. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is used to diagnose whether thyroid tissue remains in the body. However, it is difficult for human eyes to observe the specificity of SPECT images in different categories, and it is difficult for doctors to accurately diagnose the residual thyroid tissue in patients based on SPECT images. At present, the research on the classification of thyroid tissue residues after thyroidectomy is still in a blank state. This paper proposes a ResNet-18 fine-tuning method based on the convolutional neural network model. First, preprocess the SPECT images to improve the image quality and remove background interference. Secondly, use the preprocessed image samples to fine-tune the pretrained ResNet-18 model to obtain better features and finally use the Softmax classifier to diagnose the residual thyroid tissue. The method has been tested on SPECT images of 446 patients collected by local hospital and compared with the widely used lightweight network SqueezeNet model and ShuffleNetV2 model. Due to the small data set, this paper conducted 10 random grouping experiments. Each experiment divided the data set into training set and test set at a ratio of 3:1. The accuracy and sensitivity rates of the model proposed in this paper are 96.69% and 94.75%, which are significantly higher than other models (p < 0.05). The specificity and precision rates are 99.6% and 99.96%, respectively, and there is no significant difference compared with other models. (p > 0.05). The area under the curve of the proposed model, SqueezeNet, and ShuffleNetv2 are 0.988 (95% CI, 0.941–1.000), 0.898 (95% CI, 0.819–0.951) (p = 0.0257), and 0.885 (95% CI, 0.803–0.941) (p = 0.0057) (p < 0.05). We prove that this thyroid tissue residue classification system can be used as a computer-aided diagnosis method to effectively improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid tissue residues. While more accurately diagnosing patients with residual thyroid tissue in the body, we try our best to avoid the occurrence of overtreatment, which reflects its potential clinical application value.","author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Yinxiang"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jianing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiangzhi"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Meiting"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Shuyi"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Dongfei"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaobo"}],"citation-key":"guoClassificationDiagnosisResidual2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2021.762643","ISSN":"2234943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,28]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Classification and Diagnosis of Residual Thyroid Tissue in SPECT Images Based on Fine-Tuning Deep Convolutional Neural Network","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

The networks showed an accuracy of about 0.9 (90%), a sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.96. Although target regions of interest (ROIs) were selected by radiologists, meaning that radiologists still have to point out the location of the ROI, the classification of malignant lesions showed promising results. If this method is used by radiologists in clinical situations it can classify malignant lesions in a short time and support the diagnosis of radiologists in discriminating malignant lesions. Therefore, the proposed method can work in tandem with human radiologists to improve performance, which is a fundamental purpose of computer-aided diagnosis.","author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Seokmin"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Ho Kyung"},{"family":"Jeong","given":"Ja Yeon"},{"family":"Park","given":"Moon Ho"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Wonsik"},{"family":"Bang","given":"Won Chul"},{"family":"Seong","given":"Yeong Kyeong"}],"citation-key":"hanDeepLearningFramework2017","container-title":"Physics in Medicine and Biology","DOI":"10.1088/1361-6560/aa82ec","ISSN":"13616560","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,15]]},"page":"7714-7728","PMID":"28753132","publisher":"Institute of Physics Publishing","title":"A deep learning framework for supporting the classification of breast lesions in ultrasound images","type":"article-journal","volume":"62"},
  {"id":"hassijaInterpretingBlackBoxModels2024","abstract":"<p>Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodological development in a broad range of domains. In this rapidly evolving field, large number of methods are being reported using machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Majority of these models are inherently complex and lacks explanations of the decision making process causing these models to be termed as 'Black-Box'. One of the major bottlenecks to adopt such models in mission-critical application domains, such as banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and public services and safety, is the difficulty in interpreting them. Due to the rapid proleferation of these AI models, explaining their learning and decision making process are getting harder which require transparency and easy predictability. Aiming to collate the current state-of-the-art in interpreting the black-box models, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the explainable AI (XAI) models. To reduce false negative and false positive outcomes of these back-box models, finding flaws in them is still difficult and inefficient. In this paper, the development of XAI is reviewed meticulously through careful selection and analysis of the current state-of-the-art of XAI research. It also provides a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the XAI frameworks and their efficacy to serve as a starting point of XAI for applied and theoretical researchers. Towards the end, it highlights emerging and critical issues pertaining to XAI research to showcase major, model-specific trends for better explanation, enhanced transparency, and improved prediction accuracy.</p>","author":[{"family":"Hassija","given":"Vikas"},{"family":"Chamola","given":"Vinay"},{"family":"Mahapatra","given":"Atmesh"},{"family":"Singal","given":"Abhinandan"},{"family":"Goel","given":"Divyansh"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Kaizhu"},{"family":"Scardapane","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Spinelli","given":"Indro"},{"family":"Mahmud","given":"Mufti"},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Amir"}],"citation-key":"hassijaInterpretingBlackBoxModels2024","container-title":"Cognitive Computation","DOI":"10.1007/s12559-023-10179-8","ISSN":"1866-9956","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,24]]},"page":"45-74","publisher":"Springer","title":"Interpreting Black-Box Models: A Review on Explainable Artificial Intelligence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12559-023-10179-8","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"haugen2015AmericanThyroid2016","abstract":"Background: Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. Methods: The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members. Results: The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research. Conclusions: We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.","author":[{"family":"Haugen","given":"Bryan R."},{"family":"Alexander","given":"Erik K."},{"family":"Bible","given":"Keith C."},{"family":"Doherty","given":"Gerard M."},{"family":"Mandel","given":"Susan J."},{"family":"Nikiforov","given":"Yuri E."},{"family":"Pacini","given":"Furio"},{"family":"Randolph","given":"Gregory W."},{"family":"Sawka","given":"Anna M."},{"family":"Schlumberger","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Schuff","given":"Kathryn G."},{"family":"Sherman","given":"Steven I."},{"family":"Sosa","given":"Julie Ann"},{"family":"Steward","given":"David L."},{"family":"Tuttle","given":"R.

The American Thyroid Association has led the development and revision of guidelines for the management of patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The most current revision was published in the January 2016 issue of the journal Thyroid. The current guidelines have 101 recommendations, with 8 figures and 17 tables that are hopefully helpful to those treating patients with thyroid nodules and cancer. The primary goals of the American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force were to use the current evidence to guide recommendations and yet be as helpful and practical as possible within the scope and strength of the evidence. The current review focuses on new and significantly revised recommendations that may very well change clinical practice. The author notes 3 new basic principles that have emerged in this guidelines revision: 1) the management of thyroid nodules, including the decision to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy as well as follow-up decision making, will be heavily influenced by the newly developed sonographic risk pattern; 2) the long-term management of DTC along with thyroid-stimulating hormone target goals will be heavily influenced by the 4 categories of “response to therapy”; and 3) the management of patients with radioactive iodine-refractory DTC will be divided into 4 basic decision-making groups: patients who should undergo monitoring, patients who should undergo directed therapies, patients who should undergo systemic therapies, and patients who should be offered entry into clinical trials.

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the accuracy of AI-based image analysis for thyroid fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and to propose its application in clinical practice. Methods: In total, 148,395 microscopic images of FNAC were obtained from 393 thyroid nodules to train and validate the data, and EfficientNetV2-L was used as the image-classification model. The 35 nodules that were classified as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) were predicted using AI training. Results: The precision-recall area under the curve (PR AUC) was >0.95, except for poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PR AUC = 0.49) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (PR AUC = 0.91). Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma had the lowest recall (35.4%) and was difficult to distinguish from papillary thyroid carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and follicular thyroid carcinoma. Follicular adenomas and follicular thyroid carcinomas were distinguished from each other by 86.7% and 93.9% recall, respectively. For two-dimensional mapping of the data using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, the lymphomas, follicular adenomas, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas were divided into three, two, and two groups, respectively. Analysis of the AUS nodules showed 94.7% sensitivity, 14.4% specificity, 56.3% positive predictive value, and 66.7% negative predictive value. Conclusions: The authors developed an AI-based approach to analyze thyroid FNAC cases encountered in routine practice.

  {"id":"horvathAccuracyPreoperativeDiagnostic2021","abstract":"Purpose: The presence of cervical lymph node metastases is one of the most influential prognostic factors in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The management of clinically N0 neck in patients with head and neck cancer remains controversial: elective neck dissection has relatively high morbidity, adversely affecting the quality of life, however, abandoning elective neck dissection is known to compromise overall survival in numerous primaries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the conventional imaging modalities (CT, MRI, US) and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the detection of lymph node metastases in the neck. Methods: Sixty two patients were included in the study, who underwent primary tumor resection and neck dissection. Preoperative nodal status was compared with postoperative histopathology nodal status. In our retrospective study, we reviewed the patient documentation. Statistical analysis of the data—with descriptive statistics and correlation analysis—was performed with Chi-square test. Results: The sensitivity of conventional imaging modalities and FNAC were 82.8% and 81.8%, respectively, while specificity were 73.9% and 100%, respectively. Positive predictive value calculated for imaging modalities and FNAC were 82.8%, 100%, respectively, while negative predictive values were 73.9% and 66.6%, respectively. Conclusion: Neither the sensitivity of imaging modalities (CT, MRI, US) nor FNAC reached 100%, none of these methods can definitively exclude the presence of regional tumor metastasis. According to these data, no permissive alteration should be allowed from the current guidelines (e.g. NCCN) based on imaging/FNAC examinations regarding the need for elective neck dissection.","author":[{"family":"Horváth","given":"Angéla"},{"family":"Prekopp","given":"Péter"},{"family":"Polony","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Székely","given":"Eszter"},{"family":"Tamás","given":"László"},{"family":"Dános","given":"Kornél"}],"citation-key":"horvathAccuracyPreoperativeDiagnostic2021","container-title":"European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology","DOI":"10.1007/s00405-020-06324-w","ISSN":"14344726","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"page":"2041-2046","PMID":"32860560","publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","title":"Accuracy of the preoperative diagnostic workup in patients with head and neck cancers undergoing neck dissection in terms of nodal metastases","type":"article-journal","volume":"278"},

X-ray and MRI images are important sources of information to be examined for a particular type of anomalies. Reports based on the images and laboratory examination results could be mined with machine learning techniques as well. Thyroid disease diagnosis is an important capability of medical information systems. The main objective of this study is to improve the diagnosis accuracy of thyroid diseases from semantic reports and examination results using artificial neural network (ANN) in IoMT systems. In order to improve generalization and avoid over-fitting of ANN during the training process, a set of multiple multilayer perceptron (MMLP) neural network with the back-propagation error ability is proposed in this paper. Moreover, an adaptive learning rate algorithm is used to deal with the slow convergence and the local minima problem of the back-propagation error algorithm. The proposed MMLP significantly increased the overall accuracy of thyroid disease classification. With MMLP with a set of 6 networks, an improvement of 0.7% accuracy is achieved compared to a single network. In addition, comparing to the standard back-propagation, by using an adaptive learning rate algorithm in the proposed MMLP, an improvement of 4.6% accuracy and the final accuracy of 99% have been obtained in IoMT systems. The proposed MMLP is compared to recent researches reported for thyroid disease diagnosis, and its superiority is shown.","author":[{"family":"Hosseinzadeh","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Omed Hassan"},{"family":"Ghafour","given":"Marwan Yassin"},{"family":"Safara","given":"Fatemeh"},{"family":"hama","given":"Hawkar","dropping-particle":"kamaran"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Saqib"},{"family":"Vo","given":"Bay"},{"family":"Chiang","given":"Hsiu Sen"}],"citation-key":"hosseinzadehMultipleMultilayerPerceptron2021","container-title":"Journal of Supercomputing","DOI":"10.1007/s11227-020-03404-w","ISSN":"15730484","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"page":"3616-3637","publisher":"Springer","title":"A multiple multilayer perceptron neural network with an adaptive learning algorithm for thyroid disease diagnosis in the internet of medical things","type":"article-journal","volume":"77"},

Methods: Under an institutional review board-approved protocol, we conducted a single-center, retrospective review of all patients who had initial thyroidectomy for histologic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) during 2010. The presence of CLNM was examined for correlation with available preoperative clinical parameters, including tumor size, gender, age, and BRAF mutation status. Results: Cervical lymph node resection and molecular testing on FNAB or histopathologic specimen was performed on a consecutive series of 156 study patients with histologic PTC. Overall, CLNM was diagnosed in 37 % and 46 % were BRAF-mutation-positive. BRAF positivity was the only clinical parameter associated with CLNM (BRAF, p = 0.002; tumor size ≥2 cm, p = 0.16; male gender, p = 0.1; age ≥45 years, p = 0.3) and remained an independent predictor of CLNM on multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio (OR) 3.2, p = 0.001). The PPV and NPV of BRAF positivity for CLNM was 50 and 74 %, respectively. When restricting the analysis to the subset of 38 patients who had molecular testing performed preoperatively on FNAB, the PPV and NPV of BRAF positivity for CLNM was 47 and 91 %, respectively, and BRAF positivity was still a significant predictor of CLNM on both univariate (OR 8.4, p = 0.01) and multivariate (OR 9.7, p = 0.02) analyses.

Patients and Methods: A total of 512 nodules from 465 patients aged ≥60 with surgical pathology-proven thyroid nodules were enrolled in our study. The ultrasound features of thyroid nodules were independently evaluated by the ACR TI-RADS and C-TIRADS classification systems, and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted. The optimal cutoff values of the ACR TI-RADS and C-TIRADS scoring and classification systems for diagnosing elderly thyroid nodules were estimated, and the diagnostic efficacy was analyzed. Results: The ACR TI-RADS and C-TIRADS scores and classifications of thyroid cancers were both higher than benign nodules (both P < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of ACR TI-RADS and C-TIRADS scoring and classification systems were 0.861, 0.897, 0.879, and 0.900, respectively, and the AUC of the scoring system was greater than the classification system for both criteria. When the Youden index was the highest, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the ACR TI-RADS scoring and classification systems were consistent, ie, they were 89.66%, 41.70%, 89.93%, and 59.00%, respectively; the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the C-TIRADS scoring and classification systems were also consistent, ie, they were 88.71%, 44.26%, 90.23%, 59.69%, respectively. The diagnostic efficacy between the two systems was not statistically significant. Conclusion: ACR TI-RADS and C-TIRADS systems had relatively high diagnostic efficacy for elderly thyroid cancer. The diagnostic efficiency of the scoring systems of ACR TI-RADS and C-TIRADS were higher than the classification systems. In addition, the two systems had high clinical practical values, while there is still a significant risk of missed diagnosis.

  {"id":"huangCriteriaTranslationRadiomics2023","abstract":"Computer-extracted tumour characteristics have been incorporated into medical imaging computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms for decades. With the advent of radiomics, an extension of CAD involving high-throughput computer-extracted quantitative characterization of healthy or pathological structures and processes as captured by medical imaging, interest in such computer-extracted measurements has increased substantially. However, despite the thousands of radiomic studies, the number of settings in which radiomics has been successfully translated into a clinically useful tool or has obtained FDA clearance is comparatively small. This relative dearth might be attributable to factors such as the varying imaging and radiomic feature extraction protocols used from study to study, the numerous potential pitfalls in the analysis of radiomic data, and the lack of studies showing that acting upon a radiomic-based tool leads to a favourable benefit–risk balance for the patient. Several guidelines on specific aspects of radiomic data acquisition and analysis are already available, although a similar roadmap for the overall process of translating radiomics into tools that can be used in clinical care is needed.

In this review, we aim to assess the performance of C-TIRADS in malignancy risk stratification of thyroid nodules. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were searched until 1 April 2022. Original articles reporting data about C-TIRADS and setting FNA or histology as reference standards were included. C-TIRADS 4A, 4B, and 4C were set as thresholds, respectively, to obtain pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under the curve (AUC). Integrated nested Laplace approximation was used for Bayesian bivariate meta-analysis of diagnostic tests. Results: Sixteen studies were included, evaluating 11,506 thyroid nodules. The rate of malignancy in each risk classification is comparable with that in C-TIRADS. C-TIRADS 4B appeared to have better diagnostic performance than C-TIRADS 4A and 4C.

Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Data for all patients with thyroid cancers and follicular thyroid lesions who were evaluated by means of preoperative neck US were reviewed. The cervical lymph nodes were assessed for suspicion of metastasis based on US characteristics. The diagnostic accuracy of US was determined according to whether histologically confirmed cancer was present in surgical cervical lymph node specimens. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of US in predicting papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) metastasis in the central neck were 30.0% and 86.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of US in predicting metastasis in the lateral neck were 93.8% and 80.0%, respectively. A subset of patients underwent US followed by revision neck dissection for PTC, and the sensitivity and specificity of US in predicting metastasis in the lateral neck were 100% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: Preoperative neck US is a valuable tool in assessing patients with thyroid cancers. The highly sensitive and specific nature of US in predicting cervical lymph node metastasis in the lateral neck, especially in the setting of recurrent disease, can provide reliable information to assist in surgical management. Although US for central compartment lymphadenopathy in the presence of the thyroid gland is less sensitive and specific than US for the lateral neck, it still provides useful information that can be obtained at the same time the primary thyroid pathology is assessed. © 2010 The American Laryngological, Rhinological, and Otological Society, Inc.","author":[{"family":"Hwang","given":"Harry S."},{"family":"Orloff","given":"Lisa A."}],"citation-key":"hwangEfficacyPreoperativeNeck2011","container-title":"The Laryngoscope","DOI":"10.1002/lary.21227","ISSN":"0023-852X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3]]},"page":"487-491","title":"Efficacy of preoperative neck ultrasound in the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis from thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.21227","volume":"121"},
  {"id":"idarragaFalseNegativeRates2021","abstract":"Background: Thyroid nodules are common; up to 67% of adults will show nodules on high-quality ultrasound, and 95% of these nodules are benign. FNA cytology is a crucial step in determining the risk of malignancy, and a false negative diagnosis at this stage delays cancer treatment. The purpose of this study is to develop a predictive model using machine learning which can identify false negative FNA results based on less-invasive clinical data. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective medical record review at one academic and one community center. Inclusion criteria were thyroid nodules evaluated by ultrasound and FNA with a Bethesda II (benign) result or malignancy detected on pathology or FNA. Linear, non–linear, and ensemble models were generated with scikit-learn using 10-fold cross validation with repetition and compared with AUROC. The classification task was the prediction of malignancy using information acquired from less-invasive ultrasound and FNA. Results: A total of 604 subjects met inclusion criteria; 38 were diagnosed with malignancy. Of all algorithms tested, a Random Forest method achieved the best AUROC (0.64) in separating benign and malignant nodules, though the improvement over other tested algorithms was not statistically significant. Conclusions: A Random Forest model performed better than random chance using readily available data obtained via standard evaluation of thyroid nodules. The diagnostic probability threshold of this model can be varied to minimize false positives at the cost of increasing the number of false negatives. Future studies will prospectively evaluate the model's performance.","author":[{"family":"Idarraga","given":"Alexander J."},{"family":"Luong","given":"George"},{"family":"Hsiao","given":"Vivian"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"David F."}],"citation-key":"idarragaFalseNegativeRates2021","container-title":"Journal of Surgical Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jss.2021.06.076","ISSN":"10958673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"page":"562-569","PMID":"34464894","publisher":"Academic Press Inc.","title":"False Negative Rates in Benign Thyroid Nodule Diagnosis: Machine Learning for Detecting Malignancy","type":"article-journal","volume":"268"},

In this paper, we state the MIL problem as learning the Bernoulli distribution of the bag label where the bag label probability is fully parameterized by neural networks.

Notably, an application of the proposed attention-based operator provides insight into the contribution of each instance to the bag label.

The early detection of this severe disease helps doctors to provide efficient treatment. However, the discovery of this sickness at its first stages is often not easy due to similar morphological characteristics of malignant and healthy blood cells. Flow cytometry was the only used technique for early detection of leukemia, but it is very expensive and usually unavailable in hospitals. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans learn by examples. In the last few years, deep learning has achieved great successes to solve concrete problems. In particular, it has proven successful in medical imaging classification. In this work, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) experiment for the classification of malignant white blood cells from normal ones using a dataset of microscopic images.

  {"id":"IncreasedSOCS1SOCS3","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The majority of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) have good outcomes, although the identification of new predictors of a poor prognosis would be beneficial. Chronic thyroiditis is a precancerous condition in which proinflamma-tory cytokines enhance biologically aggressive features. This study investigated the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS) 1 and 3, which are negative feedback inhibitors, in PTC and benign thyroid nod-ules (BTN), and analyzed the relations among biomarker expression, pathological prognosis, and clinical features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The pathological materials and clinical data of 100 patients with PTC and 40 with BTN were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical SOCS1 and SOCS3 staining were performed. Besides comparing SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression between PTC and BTN, we analyzed the expression according to pathological factors and clinical variables. RESULTS: The expression levels of the proteins were significantly higher in PTC than in BTN (p= 0.001). SOCS1 expression was higher in older patients with PTC than in younger patients (p= 0.001). Unlike SOCS1, SOCS3 was related to the risk group; these groups were distinguished based on the American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification system (p=0.001). SOCS3 was also significantly related to lymph node involvement (p=0.007), capsule invasion (p=0.005), and extrathyroid extension (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The increased SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in PTC confirms their roles in thyroid carcinogenesis. Antibodies to both SOCS1 and SOCS3 might aid the diagnosis of PTC through immunohistological staining. SOCS3 provides information on lymph node status and aids risk stratification.","citation-key":"IncreasedSOCS1SOCS3","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202307_33134","title":"Increased SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma and its association with prognosis","type":"report"},
  {"id":"iniguez-arizaBoneMetastasesThyroid2020","abstract":"Whereas preemptive screening for the presence of lymph node and lung metastases is standard-of-care in thyroid cancer patients, bone metastases are less well studied and are often neglected in thyroid cancer patient surveillance. Bone metastases in thyroid cancer are, however, independently associated with poor/worse prognosis with a median overall survival from detection of only 4 years despite an otherwise excellent prognosis for the vast majority of thyroid cancer patients. In this review we summarize the state of current knowledge as pertinent to bony metastatic disease in thyroid cancer, including clinical implications, impacts on patient function and quality of life, pathogenesis, and therapeutic opportunities, proposing approaches to patient care accordingly. In particular, bone metastasis pathogenesis appears to reflect cooperatively between cancer and the bone microenvironment creating a “vicious cycle” of bone destruction rather than due exclusively to tumor invasion into bone. Additionally, bone metastases are more frequent in follicular and medullary thyroid cancers, requiring closer bone surveillance in patients with these histologies. Emerging data also suggest that treatments such as multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) can be less effective in controlling bone, as opposed to other (e.g. lung), metastases in thyroid cancers, making special attention to bone critical even in the setting of active MKI therapy. Although locoregional therapies including surgery, radiotherapy and ablation play important roles in palliation, antiresorptive agents including bisphosphonates and denosumab appear individually to delay and/or lessen skeletal morbidity and complications, with dosing frequency of every 3 months appearing optimal; their early application should therefore be strongly considered.","author":[{"family":"Iñiguez-Ariza","given":"Nicole M."},{"family":"Bible","given":"Keith C."},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Bart L."}],"citation-key":"iniguez-arizaBoneMetastasesThyroid2020","container-title":"Journal of Bone Oncology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbo.2020.100282","ISSN":"22121374","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"publisher":"Elsevier GmbH","title":"Bone metastases in thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"jainComputationalIntelligenceCancer2023","abstract":"Cancer is a dangerous and sometimes life-threatening disease that can have several negative consequences for the body, is a leading cause of mortality, and is becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Each form of cancer has its own set of traits, symptoms, and therapies, and early identification and management are important for a positive prognosis. Doctors utilize a variety of approaches to detect cancer, depending on the kind and location of the tumor. Imaging tests such as X-rays, Computed Tomography scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, which may provide precise pictures of the body’s interior structures to spot any abnormalities, are some of the tools that doctors use to diagnose cancer. This article evaluates computational-intelligence approaches and provides a means to impact future work by focusing on the relevance of machine learning and deep learning models such as K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Deep Neural Network, Deep Boltzmann machine, and so on. It evaluates information from 114 studies using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).

  {"id":"jangRecurrenceRiskEvaluation2023","abstract":"Background: Lymph node (LN)-related risk factors have been updated to predict long-term outcomes in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, those factors’ analytic appropriateness and general applicability must be validated. This study aimed to assess LN-related risk factors, and suggest new LN-related risk categories. Methods: This multicenter observational cohort study included 1232 patients with PTC with N1 disease treated with a total thyroidectomy and neck dissection followed by radioactive iodine remnant ablation. Results: The median follow-up duration was 117 months. In the follow-up period, structural recurrence occurred in 225 patients (18.3%). Among LN-related variables, the presence of extranodal extension (p < 0.001), the maximal diameter of metastatic LN foci (p = 0.029), the number of retrieved LNs (p = 0.003), the number of metastatic LNs (p = 0.003), and the metastatic LN ratio (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for structural recurrence. Since these factors showed a nonlinear association with the hazard ratio of recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates, we calculated their optimal cutoff values using the K-means clustering algorithm, selecting 0.2 cm and 1.1 cm for the maximal diameter of metastatic LN foci, 4 and 13 for the number of metastatic LN, and 0.28 and 0.58 for the metastatic LN ratio. The RFS curves of each subgroup classified by these newly determined cutoff values showed significant differences (p < 0.001). Each LN risk group also showed significantly different RFS rates from the others (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In PTC patients with an N1 classification, our novel LN-related risk estimates may help predict long-term outcomes and design postoperative management and follow-up strategies. After further validation studies based on independent datasets, these risk categories might be considered when redefining risk stratification or staging systems.","author":[{"family":"Jang","given":"Sung Woo"},{"family":"Park","given":"Jae Hyun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hae Rim"},{"family":"Kwon","given":"Hyeong Ju"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yu Mi"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Suck Joon"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Jong Ho"}],"citation-key":"jangRecurrenceRiskEvaluation2023","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers15020550","ISSN":"20726694","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"publisher":"MDPI","title":"Recurrence Risk Evaluation in Patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: Multicenter Machine Learning Evaluation of Lymph Node Variables","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"janssensConvolutionalNeuralNetwork2016","abstract":"Vibration analysis is a well-established technique for condition monitoring of rotating machines as the vibration patterns differ depending on the fault or machine condition. Currently, mainly manually-engineered features, such as the ball pass frequencies of the raceway, RMS, kurtosis an crest, are used for automatic fault detection. Unfortunately, engineering and interpreting such features requires a significant level of human expertise. To enable non-experts in vibration analysis to perform condition monitoring, the overhead of feature engineering for specific faults needs to be reduced as much as possible. Therefore, in this article we propose a feature learning model for condition monitoring based on convolutional neural networks. The goal of this approach is to autonomously learn useful features for bearing fault detection from the data itself. Several types of bearing faults such as outer-raceway faults and lubrication degradation are considered, but also healthy bearings and rotor imbalance are included. For each condition, several bearings are tested to ensure generalization of the fault-detection system. Furthermore, the feature-learning based approach is compared to a feature-engineering based approach using the same data to objectively quantify their performance. The results indicate that the feature-learning system, based on convolutional neural networks, significantly outperforms the classical feature-engineering based approach which uses manually engineered features and a random forest classifier. The former achieves an accuracy of 93.61 percent and the latter an accuracy of 87.25 percent.","author":[{"family":"Janssens","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Slavkovikj","given":"Viktor"},{"family":"Vervisch","given":"Bram"},{"family":"Stockman","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Loccufier","given":"Mia"},{"family":"Verstockt","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Van de Walle","given":"Rik"},{"family":"Van Hoecke","given":"Sofie"}],"citation-key":"janssensConvolutionalNeuralNetwork2016","container-title":"Journal of Sound and Vibration","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsv.2016.05.027","ISSN":"10958568","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,1]]},"page":"331-345","publisher":"Academic Press","title":"Convolutional Neural Network Based Fault Detection for Rotating Machinery","type":"article-journal","volume":"377"},

Clinical translation of MB Fpol technology requires reduction of the data analysis time that can be achieved via deep learning-based automated cell segmentation with a 2D U-Net convolutional neural network. The model was trained and tested using images of pathologically diverse human thyroid cells and evaluated by comparing the number of cells selected, segmented areas, and Fpol values obtained using automated (AU) and manual (MA) data processing methods. Overall, the model segmented 15.8% more cells than the human operator. Differences in AU and MA segmented cell areas varied between − 55.2 and + 31.0%, whereas differences in Fpol values varied from − 20.7 and + 10.7%. No statistically significant differences between AU and MA derived Fpol data were observed. The largest differences in Fpol values correlated with greatest discrepancies in AU versus MA segmented cell areas. Time required for auto-processing was reduced to 10 s versus one hour required for MA data processing. Implementation of the automated cell analysis makes quantitative fluorescence polarization-based diagnosis clinically feasible.","author":[{"family":"Jermain","given":"Peter R."},{"family":"Oswald","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Langdun","given":"Tenzin"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Santana"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Ashraf"},{"family":"Stadelmann","given":"Thilo"},{"family":"Abdulkadir","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Yaroslavsky","given":"Anna N."}],"citation-key":"jermainDeepLearningbasedCell2024","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-024-64855-2","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,1]]},"PMID":"39013980","publisher":"Nature Research","title":"Deep learning-based cell segmentation for rapid optical cytopathology of thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

The thyroid disease falls in such a category. Thyroid disorders are long-term and with carefully handled illnesses, people with thyroid disorders may also live stable and normal lives. Thyroid diagnosis, particularly for an inexperienced clinician, is a difficult proposal. Many researchers have established various methods for the diagnosis of the disease and several models for disease prediction have been developed. As with several other domains, machine learning approaches to modelling health care problems is gaining popularity. This study aims at providing solutions towards such a thyroid disease prediction. Dimension reduction techniques are applied, and reduced dimension data input to classifiers. Also, data augmentation is applied so as to be able to generate sufficient data for deep neural network model. Classifier prediction is compared to other similar researches. Real life dataset for thyroid disease has been used, and experiments conducted in distributed environment.

A total of 6324 permanent residents aged 18 years or older (mean age, 52.15 ± 11.58 years) from seven representative communities in Beijing were included in the analyses. Once informed consent was obtained, the subjects were asked to complete questionnaires, a physical examination, and thyroid ultrasound. A total of 3100 cases had TNs. The overall prevalence rate was 49.0%, and the age-standardized prevalence was 40.1%, which increased significantly as age increased (p < 0.001). The prevalence was significantly higher in females compared to males (p < 0.001), and it was significantly higher among female current smokers and former smokers compared to non-smokers (p = 0.007). There was no correlation between alcohol consumption and TNs, and there were no significant differences in the prevalence among different groups of taste preference. The prevalence decreased with an increased frequency of seafood intake (p = 0.015) and with higher literacy levels (p < 0.001). The Cochran-Armitage trend test showed that the prevalence significantly increased with decreased physical labor and exercise intensity (p < 0.001, p = 0.009). Logistic regression analysis showed that age (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.039 (1.034-1.044), p < 0.001), the female sex (OR = 1.789 (1.527-2.097)), Body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.019 (1.005-1.034)), and current smoking habits (OR = 1.246 (1.046-1.483)) were independent risk factors for TNs. Our findings indicate that there is a high prevalence of TNs in Beijing, with a higher prevalence in females than in males. Moreover, the prevalence increases as age increases. Smoking and BMI are independent risk factors for TNs. Therefore, intervention against smoking and weight loss might help reduce the risk of TN occurrence.","author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Yongfeng"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Wenhua"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haibin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Anping"},{"family":"Dou","given":"Jingtao"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Mu","given":"Yiming"}],"citation-key":"jiangPrevalenceThyroidNodules2016","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph13040442","ISSN":"16604601","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,22]]},"PMID":"27110805","publisher":"MDPI","title":"The prevalence of thyroid nodules and an analysis of related lifestyle factors in Beijing communities","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Objective: We aimed to investigation between fusion oncogenes and clinicopathological characteristics involving a large-scale cohort of patients with advanced DTC. Methods: We collected 278 tumor samples from patients with locally advanced (N1b or T4) or distant metastatic DTC. Targeted next-generation sequencing with a 26-gene ThyroLead panel was performed on these samples. Results: Fusion oncogenes accounted for 29.86% of the samples (72 rearrangement during transfection (RET) fusions, 7 neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) fusions, 4 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusions) and occurred more frequently in pediatric patients than in their adult counterparts (P =. 003, OR 2.411, 95% CI 1.329-4.311) in our cohort.

However, in adult DTCs, those with fusion oncogenes were less likely to be associated with RAI refractoriness than those without (P =. 029, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.95), owing to a high occurrence of the TERT mutation, which was the most prominent genetic risk factor for RAI refractoriness in multivariate logistic regression analysis (P <. 001, OR 7.36, 95% CI 3.14-17.27). Conclusion: Fusion oncogenes were more prevalent in pediatric DTCs than in their adult counterparts and were associated with pediatric RAI refractoriness, while in adult DTCs, TERT mutation was the dominant genetic contributor to RAI refractoriness rather than fusion oncogenes.","author":[{"family":"Ju","given":"Gaoda"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yuqing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Mu","given":"Zhuanzhuan"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Di"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Lisha"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Ruijue"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Wuying"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Yan Song"}],"citation-key":"juFusionOncogenesPatients2024","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism","DOI":"10.1210/clinem/dgad500","ISSN":"19457197","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"page":"505-515","PMID":"37622214","publisher":"Endocrine Society","title":"Fusion Oncogenes in Patients With Locally Advanced or Distant Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"109"},
  {"id":"jungBreastProstateThyroid2017","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine overdiagnosis and overtreatment related to cancer screening and to review relevant reports and studies. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and gray literature was conducted for relevant studies published between January 2000 and December 2015 reporting breast, prostate, and thyroid cancer screening tests and overdiagnosis. This study revealed no dichotomy on where screening would lower risk or cause overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Many screening tests did both, that is, at population level, there were both benefit (decreased disease-specific mortality) and harm (overdiagnosis and overtreatment). Therefore, we need to consider a balanced argument with citations for the potential benefits of screening along with the harms associated with screening. Although the benefits and harms can only be tested through randomized trials, important data from cohort studies, diagnostic accuracy studies, and modeling work can help define the extent of benefits and harms in the population. The health care cycle that prompt patients to undergo periodic screening tests is self-reinforcing. In most developed countries, screening test recommendations encourage periodic testing. Therefore, patients are continuing their screening. It is necessary for patients to become wise consumers of screening tests and make decisions with their physicians regarding further testing and treatments.","author":[{"family":"Jung","given":"Minsoo"}],"citation-key":"jungBreastProstateThyroid2017","container-title":"Current Problems in Cancer","DOI":"10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2016.11.006","ISSN":"01470272","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"page":"71-79","publisher":"Mosby Inc.","title":"Breast, prostate, and thyroid cancer screening tests and overdiagnosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0147027216300393","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"kabakerSuspiciousUltrasoundCharacteristics2012","abstract":"Background: Current American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend routine cervical ultrasound (US) in thyroid nodule evaluation. Specific US characteristics can help diagnose papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The aim of this blinded cohort study was to determine whether these specific US characteristics can also reliably detect the more aggressive variants of PTC that are often associated with the BRAFV600E mutation. Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval, we identified a cohort of patients from January 2007 to December 2009 with histologic PTC≥1cm who had cervical US, initial thyroid surgery, and molecular testing for BRAFV600E on fine-needle aspiration biopsy or histology. Preoperative US images were evaluated by a single radiologist, who was blinded to BRAF status, for nodule size and the presence or absence of the following suspicious US features: taller-than-wide shape, ill-defined margins, hypoechogenicity, calcifications, noncystic composition, and absent halo. Results: BRAF-positivity was associated with most known suspicious US findings, including taller-than-wide shape (47% vs. 7%, p<0.001), ill-defined margins (42% vs. 9%, p<0.001), hypoechogenicity (83% vs. 36%, p<0.001), micro/macrocalcifications (87% vs. 24%, p<0.001), and absent halo (85% vs. 27%, p<0.001) but was not associated with noncystic composition. When ≥3 suspicious US features were present, BRAF-positivity was predicted with a positive predictive value of 82%. The absence of suspicious US features together with negative BRAF testing predicted PTC without extrathyroidal extension or lymph node metastasis (negative predictive value 88%). Conclusions: With routine preoperative cervical US and molecular testing, a trained radiologist or surgeon can improve the preoperative characterization of PTC, potentially impacting risk stratification and initial surgical management. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.","author":[{"family":"Kabaker","given":"Adam S."},{"family":"Tublin","given":"Mitchell E."},{"family":"Nikiforov","given":"Yuri E."},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Michaele J."},{"family":"Hodak","given":"Steven P."},{"family":"Stang","given":"Michael T."},{"family":"McCoy","given":"Kelly L."},{"family":"Carty","given":"Sally E."},{"family":"Yip","given":"Linwah"}],"citation-key":"kabakerSuspiciousUltrasoundCharacteristics2012","container-title":"Thyroid","DOI":"10.1089/thy.2011.0274","ISSN":"10507256","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,1]]},"page":"585-589","PMID":"22524468","title":"Suspicious ultrasound characteristics predict BRAFV600E-positive papillary thyroid carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"karsaOptimizedHighlyRepeatable2020","abstract":"Purpose: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is an emerging technique sensitive to disease-related changes including oxygenation. It is extensively used in brain studies and has increasing clinical applications outside the brain. Here we present the first MRI acquisition protocol and QSM pipeline optimized for the head-and-neck region together with a repeatability analysis performed in healthy volunteers. Methods: We investigated both the intrasession and the intersession repeatability of the optimized method in 10 subjects. We also implemented two, Tikhonov-regularisation-based susceptibility calculation techniques that were found to have higher contrast-to-noise than existing methods in the head-and-neck region. Repeatability was evaluated by calculating the distributions of susceptibility differences between repeated scans and the corresponding minimum detectable effect sizes (MDEs). Results: Deep brain regions had higher QSM repeatability than neck regions. As expected, intrasession repeatability was generally better than intersession repeatability. Susceptibility maps calculated using projection onto dipole fields for background field removal were more repeatable than using the Laplacian boundary value method in the head-and-neck region. Small (short-axis diameter '5 mm) lymph nodes had the lowest repeatability (MDE = 0.27 ppm) as imperfect segmentation included some of the surrounding paramagnetic fatty fascia, highlighting the importance of accurate region delineation. MDEs in the larger lymph nodes (0.16 ppm), submandibular glands (0.10 ppm), and especially the parotid glands (0.06 ppm) were much lower, comparable to those of the brain regions. Conclusions: The high repeatability of the acquisition and pipeline optimized for QSM will facilitate clinical studies in the head-and-neck region.","author":[{"family":"Karsa","given":"Anita"},{"family":"Punwani","given":"Shonit"},{"family":"Shmueli","given":"Karin"}],"citation-key":"karsaOptimizedHighlyRepeatable2020","container-title":"Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/mrm.28377","ISSN":"0740-3194","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,3]]},"page":"3206-3222","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc","title":"An optimized and highly repeatable MRI acquisition and processing pipeline for quantitative susceptibility mapping in the head‐and‐neck region","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.28377","volume":"84"},

Disease diagnoses could be sometimes very easy tasks, while others may be a bit trickier.

The traditional methods which are used to diagnose a disease are manual and error-prone. Usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) predictive techniques enables auto diagnosis and reduces detection errors compared to exclusive human expertise.

A detailed analysis of those articles was conducted in order to classify most used AI techniques for medical diagnostic systems. We further discuss various diseases along with corresponding techniques of AI, including Fuzzy Logic, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. This research paper aims to reveal some important insights into current and previous different AI techniques in the medical field used in today's medical research, particularly in heart disease prediction, brain disease, prostate, liver disease, and kidney disease.

  {"id":"kentConceptualFrameworkPrognostic2020","abstract":"Background: Prognostic research has many important purposes, including (i) describing the natural history and clinical course of health conditions, (ii) investigating variables associated with health outcomes of interest, (iii) estimating an individual's probability of developing different outcomes, (iv) investigating the clinical application of prediction models, and (v) investigating determinants of recovery that can inform the development of interventions to improve patient outcomes. But much prognostic research has been poorly conducted and interpreted, indicating that a number of conceptual areas are often misunderstood. Recent initiatives to improve this include the Prognosis Research Strategy (PROGRESS) and the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Statement. In this paper, we aim to show how different categories of prognostic research relate to each other, to differentiate exploratory and confirmatory studies, discuss moderators and mediators, and to show how important it is to understand study designs and the differences between prediction and causation. Main text: We propose that there are four main objectives of prognostic studies - description, association, prediction and causation. By causation, we mean the effect of prediction and decision rules on outcomes as determined by intervention studies and the investigation of whether a prognostic factor is a determinant of outcome (on the causal pathway). These either fall under the umbrella of exploratory (description, association, and prediction model development) or confirmatory (prediction model external validation and investigation of causation). Including considerations of causation within a prognostic framework provides a more comprehensive roadmap of how different types of studies conceptually relate to each other, and better clarity about appropriate model performance measures and the inferences that can be drawn from different types of prognostic studies. We also propose definitions of 'candidate prognostic factors', 'prognostic factors', 'prognostic determinants (causal)' and 'prognostic markers (non-causal)'. Furthermore, we address common conceptual misunderstandings related to study design, analysis, and interpretation of multivariable models from the perspectives of association, prediction and causation. Conclusion: This paper uses a framework to clarify some concepts in prognostic research that remain poorly understood and implemented, to stimulate discussion about how prognostic studies can be strengthened and appropriately interpreted.","author":[{"family":"Kent","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Boyle","given":"Eleanor"},{"family":"Cancelliere","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Cassidy","given":"J.

Recent studies show that this mutation occurs more frequently in patients with PTC showing aggressive clinicopathologic features. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of the BRAF V600E mutation in tumor samples and its association with high-risk clinicopathologic features prospectively. Patients and methods: From February 2009 to January 2010, 547 PTC patients who underwent surgery in Seoul National University Hospital were enrolled in the study. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify exon 15 of the BRAF gene from paraffin-embedded thyroid tumor specimens, followed by direct sequencing to detect the BRAF V600E mutation. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze associations between the BRAF V600E mutation and clinicopathologic features. Results: The BRAF V600E mutation was found in 381/547 (69.7%) patients with primary PTC. The BRAF V600E mutation was significantly associated with age (≥45 years), tumor size (>1 cm), extrathyroidal extension, and cervical lymph node metastases (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that it was significantly associated with gender (OR = 1.834; 95% CI 1.021-3.463), tumor size (OR = 1.972; 95% CI 1.250-3.103), and extra-thyroidal extension (OR = 2.428; 95% CI 1.484-3.992), but not with age, multifocality, lymph node metastases, and advanced disease stage. The proportion of BRAF V600E mutation was significantly associated with the number of high-risk factors of tumor recurrence (P < 0.001).

  {"id":"kimMultimodalNeuralNetwork2023","abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common endocrine carcinoma and has frequent recurrence instances. Although PTC recurrence has been predicted using predictors established using various features and techniques, its early detection is still challenging. To address this issue, it is aimed to develop a deep-learning model that utilizes not only the initial medical records but also the thyroid function tests (TFTs) performed periodically post-surgery. Herein, a novel multimodal prediction model, called the hybrid architecture for multimodal analysis (HAMA), that can analyze numeric and time-series data simultaneously, is proposed. For quantitative evaluation, fourfold cross validation is conducted on data of 1613 PTC patients including 63 locoregional recurrence patients, and the HAMA is achieved the following performance: sensitivity (0.9688); specificity (0.9781); F1-score (0.7943); and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, AUROC (0.9863). Furthermore, a real-time prediction simulation is conducted at 6-month intervals by reconstructing the data of each patient into real-time data. It is demonstrated in the real-time simulation results that the HAMA predicts PTC recurrence at least 1.5 years in advance by recalculating the recurrence probability using the additional follow-up data. To the best of the knowledge, the HAMA is the first deep-learning model to reflect continuous change in the physical condition of a patient post-surgery.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Geun Hyeong"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Dong Hwa"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Jee Woo"},{"family":"Jeon","given":"Hyun Jeong"},{"family":"Park","given":"Seung"}],"citation-key":"kimMultimodalNeuralNetwork2023","container-title":"Advanced Intelligent Systems","DOI":"10.1002/aisy.202200365","ISSN":"26404567","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc","title":"Multimodal Neural Network for Recurrence Prediction of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"kimPredictiveValueIntratumoral2015","abstract":"The current study was aimed to investigate the clinical value of intratumoral heterogeneity of F-18 FDG uptake for characterization of thyroid nodule (TN) with inconclusive fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results. The current study enrolled 200 patients who showed F-18 FDG incidentaloma and were performed FNAB. The intratumoral heterogeneity of F-18 FDG uptake was represented as the heterogeneity factor (HF), defined as the derivative (dV/dT) of a volume-threshold function for a primary tumor. The diagnostic and predictive values of HF and F-18 FDG PET/CT parameters were evaluated for characterization of inconclusive FNAB results. Among F-18 FDG PET/CT parameters, SUVmax, MTV, and TLG of malignant group were statistically higher than those of Bethesda category of suspicious malignant group. However, HF values were not statistically different between the groups of Bethesda categories (Kruskal–Wallis statistics, 9.924; p = 0.0774). In ROC analysis, when HF > 2.751 was used as cut-off value, the sensitivity and specificity for prediction of malignant TN were 100 % (95 % CI 69.2–100 %) and 60 % (95 % CI 42.1–76.1 %), respectively.

  {"id":"krajewskaEarlyDiagnosisLowRisk2020","abstract":"We are witnessing a rapid worldwide increase in the incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in the last thirty years. Extensive implementation of cancer screening and wide availability of neck ultrasound or other imaging studies is the main reason responsible for this phenomenon. It resulted in a detection of a growing number of clinically asymptomatic PTCs, mainly low-risk tumors, without any beneficial impact on survival. An indolent nature of low-risk PTC, particularly papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), and the excellent outcomes raise an ongoing discussion regarding the adequacy of treatment applied. The question of whether PTMC is overtreated or not is currently completed by another, whether PTMC requires any treatment. Current ATA guidelines propose less extensive preoperative diagnostics and, if differentiated thyroid cancer is diagnosed, less aggressive surgical approach and limit indications for postoperative radioiodine therapy. However, in intrathyroidal PTMCs in the absence of lymph node or distant metastases, active surveillance may constitute alternative management with a low progression rate of 1%–5% and without any increase in the risk of poorer outcomes related to delayed surgery in patients, in whom it was necessary.

Here, we aimed to develop a deep-learning-based CT-free quantitative thyroid SPECT that can generate an attenuation map (μ-map) and automatically segment the thyroid. Methods: Quantitative thyroid SPECT/CT data (n = 650) were retrospectively analyzed. Typical 3D U-Nets were used for the μ-map generation and automatic thyroid segmentation. Primary emission and scattering SPECTs were inputted to generate a μ-map, and the original μ-map from CT was labeled (268 and 30 for training and validation, respectively). The generated μ-map and primary emission SPECT were inputted for the automatic thyroid segmentation, and the manual thyroid segmentation was labeled (280 and 36 for training and validation, respectively). Other thyroid SPECT/CT (n = 36) and salivary SPECT/CT (n = 29) were employed for verification. Results: The synthetic μ-map demonstrated a strong correlation (R2 = 0.972) and minimum error (mean square error = 0.936 × 10−4, %normalized mean absolute error = 0.999%) of attenuation coefficients when compared to the ground truth (n = 30). Compared to manual segmentation, the automatic thyroid segmentation was excellent with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.767, minimal thyroid volume difference of − 0.72 mL, and a short 95% Hausdorff distance of 9.416 mm (n = 36). Additionally, %thyroid uptake by synthetic μ-map and automatic thyroid segmentation (CT-free SPECT) was similar to that by the original μ-map and manual thyroid segmentation (SPECT/CT) (3.772 ± 5.735% vs. 3.682 ± 5.516%, p = 0.1090) (n = 36). Furthermore, the synthetic μ-map generation and automatic thyroid segmentation were successfully performed in the salivary SPECT/CT using the deep-learning algorithms trained by thyroid SPECT/CT (n = 29).

This study aimed to evaluate whether a radiomics study of gray-scale ultrasound can predict the presence or absence of B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation in papillary thyroid cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study retrospectively included 96 thyroid nodules that were surgically confirmed papillary thyroid cancers between January 2012 and June 2013. BRAF mutation was positive in 48 nodules and negative in 48 nodules. For analysis, ROIs from the nodules were demarcated manually on both longitudinal and transverse sonographic images. We extracted a total of 86 radiomics features derived from histogram parameters, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, intensity size zone matrix, and shape features. These features were used to build 3 different classifier models, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, of the different models was evaluated. RESULTS: The incidence of high-suspicion nodules diagnosed on ultrasound was higher in the BRAF mutation-positive group than in the mutation-negative group (P ¼.004). The radiomics approach demonstrated that all classification models showed moderate performance for predicting the presence of BRAF mutation in papillary thyroid cancers with an area under the curve value of 0.651, accuracy of 64.3%, sensitivity of 66.8%, and specificity of 61.8%, on average, for the 3 models.

  {"id":"laiadiContrastiveMetricLearning","abstract":"Conventional structural health monitoring methods for interpreting unlabeled acoustic emission (AE) data typically rely on generic clustering approaches. This work introduces a novel approach for analyzing sequential and temporal acoustic emission (AE) data streams by enhancing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a contrastive metric learning loss function (MLP-CMLL)and Time Series K-means (TSKmeans) clustering. This dual approach, MLP-CMLL with TSKmeans, is crafted to refine cluster differentiation significantly. This method is designed to optimize cluster differentiation, bringing similar acoustic patterns closer and distancing divergent ones, thereby improving the MLP's ability to classify acoustic events over time. Addressing the limitations of traditional clustering algorithms in handling the temporal dynamics of AE data, MLP-CMLL with TSKmeans approach provides deeper insights into cluster formation and evolution. It promises enhanced monitoring and predictive maintenance capabilities in engineering applications by capturing the complex dynamics of AE data more effectively, offering a significant advancement in the field of structural health monitoring. Through experimental validation, we apply this method to characterize the loosening phenomenon in bolted structures under vibrations. Comparative analysis with two standard clustering methods using raw streaming data from three experimental campaigns demonstrates that our proposed method not only delivers valuable qualitative information concerning the time-line of clusters but also showcases superior performance in Oualid Laiadi et al.

  {"id":"laiMachineLearningbasedDynamic2022","abstract":"Objective: To develop a web-based machine learning server to predict lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients. Methods: Clinical data for PTC patients who underwent primary thyroidectomy at our hospital between January 2015 and December 2020, with pathologically confirmed presence or absence of any LLNM finding, were retrospectively reviewed. We built all models from a training set (80%) and assessed them in a test set (20%), using algorithms including decision tree, XGBoost, random forest, support vector machine, neural network, and K-nearest neighbor algorithm. Their performance was measured against a previously established nomogram using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, specificity, and sensitivity. Interpretable machine learning was used for identifying potential relationships between variables and LLNM, and a web-based tool was created for use by clinicians. Results: A total of 1135 (62.53%) out of 1815 PTC patients enrolled in this study experienced LLNM episodes. In predicting LLNM, the best algorithm was random forest. In determining feature importance, the AUC reached 0.80, with an accuracy of 0.74, sensitivity of 0.89, and F1 score of 0.81. In addition, DCA showed that random forest held a higher clinical net benefit. Random forest identified tumor size, lymph node microcalcification, age, lymph node size, and tumor location as the most influentials in predicting LLNM. And the website tool is freely accessible at http://43.138.62.202/. Conclusion: The results showed that machine learning can be used to enable accurate prediction for LLNM in PTC patients, and that the web tool allowed for LLNM risk assessment at the individual level.","author":[{"family":"Lai","given":"Sheng-wei"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Yun-long"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yu-hua"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Wan","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Pei-lin"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Han-dai"}],"citation-key":"laiMachineLearningbasedDynamic2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2022.1019037","ISSN":"1664-2392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,10]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Machine learning-based dynamic prediction of lateral lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.1019037/full","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"landaGenomicTranscriptomicHallmarks2016","abstract":"BACKGROUND. Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) are rare and frequently lethal tumors that so far have not been subjected to comprehensive genetic characterization. METHODS. We performed next-generation sequencing of 341 cancer genes from 117 patient-derived PDTCs and ATCs and analyzed the transcriptome of a representative subset of 37 tumors. Results were analyzed in the context of The Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA study) of papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). RESULTS. Compared to PDTCs, ATCs had a greater mutation burden, incluDing a higher frequency of mutations in TP53, TERT promoter, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway effectors, SWI/SNF subunits, and histone methyltransferases. BRAF and RAS were the predominant drivers and dictated distinct tropism for nodal versus distant metastases in PDTC. RAS and BRAF sharply distinguished between PDTCs defined by the Turin (PDTC-Turin) versus MSKCC (PDTC-MSK) criteria, respectively. Mutations of EIF1AX, a component of the translational preinitiation complex, were markedly enriched in PDTCs and ATCs and had a striking pattern of co-occurrence with RAS mutations. While TERT promoter mutations were rare and subclonal in PTCs, they were clonal and highly prevalent in advanced cancers. Application of the TCGA-derived BRAF-RAS score (a measure of MAPK transcriptional output) revealed a preserved relationship with BRAF/RAS mutation in PDTCs, whereas ATCs were BRAF-like irrespective of driver mutation. CONCLUSIONS. These data support a model of tumorigenesis whereby PDTCs and ATCs arise from well-differentiated tumors through the accumulation of key additional genetic abnormalities, many of which have prognostic and possible therapeutic relevance. The widespread genomic disruptions in ATC compared with PDTC underscore their greater virulence and higher mortality.","author":[{"family":"Landa","given":"Iñigo"},{"family":"Ibrahimpasic","given":"Tihana"},{"family":"Boucai","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Sinha","given":"Rileen"},{"family":"Knauf","given":"Jeffrey A."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Ronak H."},{"family":"Dogan","given":"Snjezana"},{"family":"Ricarte-Filho","given":"Julio C."},{"family":"Krishnamoorthy","given":"Gnana P."},{"family":"Xu","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Nikolaus"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Sander","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Barry S."},{"family":"Ghossein","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"Ganly","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Fagin","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"landaGenomicTranscriptomicHallmarks2016","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","DOI":"10.1172/JCI85271","ISSN":"15588238","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,1]]},"page":"1052-1066","PMID":"26878173","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","title":"Genomic and transcriptomic hallmarks of poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers","type":"article-journal","volume":"126"},
  {"id":"ledigPhotoRealisticSingleImage2016","abstract":"Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.","author":[{"family":"Ledig","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Theis","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Huszar","given":"Ferenc"},{"family":"Caballero","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Cunningham","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Acosta","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Aitken","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Tejani","given":"Alykhan"},{"family":"Totz","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zehan"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Wenzhe"}],"citation-key":"ledigPhotoRealisticSingleImage2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,15]]},"title":"Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802"},
  {"id":"leeApplicationDeepLearning2019","abstract":"Purpose: To develop a deep learning–based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for use in the CT diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with thyroid cancer. Methods: A total of 995 axial CT images that included benign (n = 647) and malignant (n = 348) lymph nodes were collected from 202 patients with thyroid cancer who underwent CT for surgical planning between July 2017 and January 2018. The datasets were randomly split into training (79.0%), validation (10.5%), and test (10.5%) datasets. Eight deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were used to classify the images into metastatic or benign lymph nodes. Pretrained networks were used on the ImageNet and the best-performing algorithm was selected. Class-specific discriminative regions were visualized with attention heatmap using a global average pooling method. Results: The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for the tested algorithms ranged from 0.909 to 0.953. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the best-performing algorithm were all 90.4%, respectively. Attention heatmap highlighted important subregions for further clinical review. Conclusion: A deep learning–based CAD system could accurately classify cervical LNM in patients with thyroid cancer on preoperative CT with an AUROC of 0.953. Whether this approach has clinical utility will require evaluation in a clinical setting. Key Points: • A deep learning–based CAD system could accurately classify cervical lymph node metastasis. The AUROC for the eight tested algorithms ranged from 0.909 to 0.953. • Of the eight models, the ResNet50 algorithm was the best-performing model for the validation dataset with 0.953 AUROC.

According to the findings of this review, indeed, the following attributes would be important variables for the early diagnosis of thyroid disease: clinical stage, marital status, histological type, age, nerve injury symptom, economic income, surgery type [the quality of life 3 months after thyroid cancer surgery]; tumor diameter, symptoms, extrathyroidal extension [the local recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma]; RNA feasures including ADD3-AS1 (downregulation), MIR100HG (downregulation), FAM95C (downregulation), MORC2-AS1 (downregulation), LINC00506 (downregulation), ST7-AS1 (downregulation), LOC339059 (downregulation), MIR181A2HG (upregulation), FAM181A-AS1 (downregulation), LBX2-AS1 (upregulation), BLACAT1 (upregulation), hsa-miR-9-5p (downregulation), hsa-miR-146b-3p (upregulation), hsa-miR-199b-5p (downregulation), hsa-miR-4709-3p (upregulation), hsa-miR-34a-5p (upregulation), hsa-miR-214-3p (downregulation) [papillary thyroid carcinoma]; gut microbiota RNA features such as veillonella, paraprevotella, neisseria, rheinheimera [hypothyroidism]; and ultrasound features, i.e., wreath-shaped feature, micro-calcification, strain ratio [the malignancy of thyroid nodules].","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Kwang Sig"},{"family":"Park","given":"Hyuntae"}],"citation-key":"leeMachineLearningThyroid2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Bioscience - Landmark","DOI":"10.31083/j.fbl2703101","ISSN":"27686698","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"PMID":"35345333","publisher":"Bioscience Research Institute","title":"Machine learning on thyroid disease: a review","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"leePrognosticsHealthManagement2014","abstract":"Much research has been conducted in prognostics and health management (PHM), an emerging field in mechanical engineering that is gaining interest from both academia and industry. Most of these efforts have been in the area of machinery PHM, resulting in the development of many algorithms for this particular application. The majority of these algorithms concentrate on applications involving common rotary machinery components, such as bearings and gears. Knowledge of this prior work is a necessity for any future research efforts to be conducted; however, there has not been a comprehensive overview that details previous and on-going efforts in PHM. In addition, a systematic method for developing and deploying a PHM system has yet to be established. Such a method would enable rapid customization and integration of PHM systems for diverse applications. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the PHM field, followed by an introduction of a systematic PHM design methodology, 5S methodology, for converting data to prognostics information. This methodology includes procedures for identifying critical components, as well as tools for selecting the most appropriate algorithms for specific applications. Visualization tools are presented for displaying prognostics information in an appropriate fashion for quick and accurate decision making.

  {"id":"lewUseUltrasoundManagement2010","abstract":"The use of ultrasound for thyroid cancer has evolved dramatically over the last few decades. Since the late 1960s, ultrasound has become essential in the examination of the thyroid gland with the increased availability of high-frequency linear array transducers and computer-enhanced imaging capabilities of modern day portable ultrasound equipment in a clinic- or office-based setting. As a noninvasive, rapid, and easily reproducible imaging study, ultrasound has been demonstrated to have a broadened utility beyond the simple confirmation of thyroid nodules and their sizes. Recently, office-based ultrasound has become an integral part of clinical practice, where it has demonstrated overwhelming benefits to patients being evaluated and treated for thyroid cancer. Ultrasound has become useful in the qualitative characterization of thyroid nodules based on benign or malignant features. On the basis of such classifications and the relative risk for thyroid malignancy, the need for ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, preoperative and intraoperative staging, lymph node mapping, and the extent of surgery can subsequently be determined. Furthermore, ultrasound has additional value in the surveillance of patients treated for thyroid cancer.","author":[{"family":"Lew","given":"John I."},{"family":"Solorzano","given":"Carmen C."}],"citation-key":"lewUseUltrasoundManagement2010","container-title":"The Oncologist","DOI":"10.1634/theoncologist.2009-0324","ISSN":"1083-7159","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",3,1]]},"page":"253-258","PMID":"20215358","publisher":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","title":"Use of Ultrasound in the Management of Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

A total of 525 patients with thyroid nodules (malignant, n = 228; benign, n = 297) underwent conventional ultrasonography, strain elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Six algorithms were compared: support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LG), GlmNet, and K-nearest neighbors (K-NN). The diagnostic performances of the 13 suspicious sonographic features for discriminating benign and malignant thyroid nodules were assessed using different ML algorithms. To compare these algorithms, a 10-fold cross-validation paired t-test was applied to the algorithm performance differences. Results: The logistic regression algorithm had better diagnostic performance than the other ML algorithms. However, it was only slightly higher than those of GlmNet, LDA, and RF.

Risk stratification guided by refined information becomes a crucial step toward the goal of personalized medicine. The diagnosis of TC mainly relies on imaging analysis, but visual examination may not reveal much information and not enable comprehensive analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology used to extract and quantify key image information by simulating complex human functions. This latent, precise information contributes to stratify TC on the distinct risk and drives tailored management to transit from the surface (population-based) to a point (individual-based). In this review, we started with several challenges regarding personalized care in TC, for example, inconsistent rating ability of ultrasound physicians, uncertainty in cytopathological diagnosis, difficulty in discriminating follicular neoplasms, and inaccurate prognostication. We then analyzed and summarized the advances of AI to extract and analyze morphological, textural, and molecular features to reveal the ground truth of TC.

  {"id":"liClinicalValueArtificial2023","abstract":"Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a commercial artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted ultrasonography (US) for thyroid nodules and to validate its value in real-world medical practice. Materials and methods: From March 2021 to July 2021, 236 consecutive patients with 312 suspicious thyroid nodules were prospectively enrolled in this study. One experienced radiologist performed US examinations with a real-time AI system (S-Detect). US images and AI reports of the nodules were recorded. Nine residents and three senior radiologists were invited to make a “benign” or “malignant” diagnosis based on recorded US images without knowing the AI reports. After referring to AI reports, the diagnosis was made again. The diagnostic performance of AI, residents, and senior radiologists with and without AI reports were analyzed. Results: The sensitivity, accuracy, and AUC of the AI system were 0.95, 0.84, and 0.753, respectively, and were not statistically different from those of the experienced radiologists, but were superior to those of the residents (all p < 0.01). The AI-assisted resident strategy significantly improved the accuracy and sensitivity for nodules ≤ 1.5 cm (all p < 0.01), while reducing the unnecessary biopsy rate by up to 27.7% for nodules > 1.5 cm (p = 0.034). Conclusions: The AI system achieved performance, for cancer diagnosis, comparable to that of an average senior thyroid radiologist. The AI-assisted strategy can significantly improve the overall diagnostic performance for less-experienced radiologists, while increasing the discovery of thyroid cancer ≤ 1.5 cm and reducing unnecessary biopsies for nodules > 1.5 cm in real-world medical practice. Key Points: • The AI system reached a senior radiologist-like level in the evaluation of thyroid cancer and could significantly improve the overall diagnostic performance of residents. • The AI-assisted strategy significantly improved ≤ 1.5 cm thyroid cancer screening AUC, accuracy, and sensitivity of the residents, leading to an increased detection of thyroid cancer while maintaining a comparable specificity to that of radiologists alone. • The AI-assisted strategy significantly reduced the unnecessary biopsy rate for thyroid nodules > 1.5 cm by the residents, while maintaining a comparable sensitivity to that of radiologists alone.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yingying"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yihao"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xinyang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Mingbo"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Yukun"}],"citation-key":"liClinicalValueArtificial2023","container-title":"European Radiology","DOI":"10.1007/s00330-022-09378-y","ISSN":"14321084","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,1]]},"page":"4513-4523","PMID":"36622410","publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","title":"Clinical value of artificial intelligence in thyroid ultrasound: a prospective study from the real world","type":"article-journal","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"liDeepReinforcementLearning2021","abstract":"Accurate and automated lymph node segmentation is pivotal for quantitatively accessing disease progression and potential therapeutics. The complex variation of lymph node morphology and the difficulty of acquiring voxel-wise manual annotations make lymph node segmentation a challenging task. Since the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) annotation, which indicates the location, length, and width of a lymph node, is commonly available in hospital data archives, we advocate to use RECIST annotations as the supervision, and thus formulate this segmentation task into a weakly-supervised learning problem. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based lymph node segmentation (DRL-LNS) model. Based on RECIST annotations, we segment RECIST-slices in an unsupervised way to produce pseudo ground truths, which are then used to train U-Net as a segmentation network. Next, we train a DRL model, in which the segmentation network interacts with the policy network to optimize the lymph node bounding boxes and segmentation results simultaneously. The proposed DRL-LNS model was evaluated against three widely used image segmentation networks on a public thoracoabdominal Computed Tomography (CT) dataset that contains 984 3D lymph nodes, and achieves the mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 77.17% and the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 64.78% in the four-fold cross-validation. Our results suggest that the DRL-based bounding box prediction strategy outperforms the label propagation strategy and the proposed DRL-LNS model is able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on this weakly-supervised lymph node segmentation task.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Zhe"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Yong"}],"citation-key":"liDeepReinforcementLearning2021","container-title":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","DOI":"10.1109/JBHI.2020.3008759","ISSN":"21682208","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"page":"774-783","PMID":"32749988","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning for Weakly-Supervised Lymph Node Segmentation in CT Images","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

The objective of our study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) in the risk stratification of thyroid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed for articles published before July 31, 2019. We included studies using ACR TI-RADS for stratification of thyroid nodules and cytology results from ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), pathology results from surgical resection of the thyroid, or both FNAB cytology and surgical pathology results as the reference standard. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated with the bivariate random-effects modeling and are visually presented in forest plots. We performed multiple subgroup analyses and meta-regression to explore the effects of various clinical settings. We compared ACR TI-RADS with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines and Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS) in studies providing head-to-head comparison. RESULTS. Sixteen studies with 18,614 patients involving a total of 21,882 nodules, were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of ACR TI-RADS were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81- 0.93) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.78), respectively. The calculated area under summary ROC curve was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.89), with a diagnostic odds ratio of 18.46 (95% CI, 9.77- 34.88). Meta-regression revealed that patient number was a significant factor for heterogeneity (p = 0.02). Ten studies compared the performance of ACR TI-RADS and ATA guidelines: The pooled sensitivity was 0.83 versus 0.87 (p = 0.5), respectively, and the pooled specificity was 0.69 versus 0.50 (p = 0.1). In six studies providing direct comparison of ACR TI-RADS and Korean TIRADS, the pooled sensitivity was 0.85 versus 0.91 (p = 0.13), and the pooled specificity was 0.57 versus 0.24 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. ACR TI-RADS showed favorable sensitivity and moderate specificity in risk stratification of thyroid nodules. The use of ACR TI-RADS could avoid a large number of unnecessary biopsies, although at the cost of a slight decline in sensitivity.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yueming"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lanlan"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yuan"}],"citation-key":"liDiagnosticPerformanceAmerican2021","container-title":"American Journal of Roentgenology","DOI":"10.2214/AJR.19.22691","ISSN":"15463141","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"38-47","PMID":"32603229","publisher":"American Roentgen Ray Society","title":"Diagnostic performance of American college of radiology TI-RADS: A systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","volume":"216"},
  {"id":"liGlobalTrendsThyroid2020","abstract":"Background: Thyroid cancer (TC) incidence rates have been increasing in many countries, predominantly due to overdiagnosis. It is, however, not yet clear whether a true increase in exposure to risk factors might have also contributed to the TC epidemic. We assessed the TC mortality trends, which should not be affected by overdiagnosis, to disentangle the specific contribution of period and cohort effects. Methods: We analyzed long-term mortality data in 24 countries from 5 continents using age-period-cohort (APC) models. Nonidentifiability of the APC models was circumvented by integrating evidence of a consistent relationship between age and TC mortality, allowing to estimate period and cohort linear effects. Results: Substantial heterogeneity existed in the historical TC mortality rates across countries, but long-term rates declined over time in most of the countries, converging around a value of 0.5/100,000. The shape of the age-specific curves was consistently similar across countries and periods, resembling straight lines on the log-log scale, with the slopes ranging between 4.0 and 6.0. Both period and cohort effects showed long-term declines in most countries for both genders. In some countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, substantial long-term declines by period were visible until the 1980s and 1990s, but then stabilized or increased slightly. Declining cohort effects were also seen in almost all countries, and were particularly pronounced in women from Switzerland, whereas stable cohort effects were recorded in South Africa. Although there were some indications of possible increasing risks of deaths among the youngest generations in some countries for both men and women, changes are too recent to be treated as unequivocal and estimates suffered from large statistical variability due to small numbers of deaths. Conclusions: Global long-term declines in TC mortality have been accompanied by downward trends in both period and cohort effects. Our results suggest lack of evidence of a possible major contribution of \"real\"risk factors in TC mortality, and indirectly confirm the main role of overdiagnosis in the epidemic of TC incidence.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Mengmeng"},{"family":"Maso","given":"Luigino Dal"},{"family":"Vaccarella","given":"Salvatore"}],"citation-key":"liGlobalTrendsThyroid2020","container-title":"The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology","DOI":"10.1016/S2213-8587(20)30115-7","ISSN":"22138587","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"page":"468-470","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","title":"Global trends in thyroid cancer incidence and the impact of overdiagnosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213858720301157","volume":"8"},

This study aims to evaluate the impact of regional patterns of cervical lymph node metastases on lung metastases in pediatric TC. Methods: Retrospective analysis was conducted on data from pediatric TC patients spanning the years 2000 to 2018. We compared the rates of lymph node metastasis (LNR), the number of lymph node metastases, and the number of dissected lymph nodes in the central and lateral cervical regions between patients with and without lung metastases. Statistical methods were employed to adjust for confounders during hypothesis testing. Results: A total of 227 pediatric patients, with a median age of 15.12 ± 2.84 years, were included in the study. Of these, 202 (89 %) exhibited LN metastasis, with 40(17.62 %) patients presenting with lung metastasis. Patients with lung metastases were found to be younger (13.40 ± 3.11 vs. 15.50 ± 2.64, p < 0.001), had larger primary tumor diameters (3.49 ± 1.98 vs. 2.31 ± 1.45, p < 0.001), and exhibited a higher number of lymph node metastases (23.40 ± 10.75 vs. 14.65 ± 13.16, p < 0.001). Notably, in patients with LN metastases, the presence of >12 lateral cervical lymph node metastases emerged as a significant risk factor for lung metastases. Among children with metachronous lung metastases, the median time to detection of lung metastases was 43 (12−132) months, and they appeared to receive a greater proportion of radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment compared to those with synchronous lung metastases.

Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 274 patients with thyroid nodules who underwent fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology or surgery from October 2018 to 2020 in Xianyang Central Hospital. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression analysis and logistic analysis were applied to screen and identified variables. Six machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR), were employed and compared in constructing the predictive model, coupled with preoperative clinical characteristics and ultrasound features. Internal validation was performed by using 10-fold cross-validation. The performance of the model was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) plot, feature importance, and correlation of features. The best cutoff value for risk stratification was identified by probability density function (PDF) and clinical utility curve (CUC). Results: The malignant rate of thyroid nodules in the study cohort was 53.2%. The predictive models are constructed by age, margin, shape, echogenic foci, echogenicity, and lymph nodes. The XGBoost model was significantly superior to any one of the machine learning models, with an AUC value of 0.829. According to the PDF and CUC, we recommended that 51% probability be used as a threshold for determining the risk stratification of malignant nodules, where about 85.6% of patients with malignant nodules could be detected. Meanwhile, approximately 89.8% of unnecessary biopsy procedures would be saved. Finally, an online web risk calculator has been built to estimate the personal likelihood of malignant thyroid nodules based on the best-performing ML-ed model of XGBoost. Conclusions: Combining clinical characteristics and features of ultrasound images, ML algorithms can achieve reliable prediction of malignant thyroid nodules. The online web risk calculator based on the XGBoost model can easily identify in real-time the probability of malignant thyroid nodules, which can assist clinicians to formulate individualized management strategies for patients.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Wanying"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Jianqiang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wencai"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yuwen"},{"family":"He","given":"Cunyu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xinxin"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Chan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yuanyuan"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Chenyu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenle"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Chengliang"}],"citation-key":"liIncorporationMachineLearning2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.968784","ISSN":"2234943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Incorporation of a machine learning pathological diagnosis algorithm into the thyroid ultrasound imaging data improves the diagnosis risk of malignant thyroid nodules","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"linBRAFMutationPredictive2010","abstract":"Background: This study analyzed the utility of BRAF mutation screening of ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens for predicting aggressive clinicopathological characteristics of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). Methods: We assessed the T1799A BRAF mutation status in FNAB specimens obtained from 61 PTMC patients before undergoing operations for PTMC. We examined whether the BRAF mutation was associated with clinicopathologic characteristics in PTMC. Additionally, we reviewed the BRAF mutation status, and clinical, ultrasound (US), hematological, and pathology records of the patients and analyzed the associations between these characteristics and lateral lymph node metastasis (LNM). Results: Analysis of the preoperative FNABs accurately reflected the BRAF status of the resected tissues in 19 of the 20 paired samples (95% concordance). We observed that the BRAF mutation was statistically significantly associated with multifocality, extrathyroidal invasion, lateral LNM, and advanced tumor stages III and IV. The BRAF mutation, pathologic features (central LNM), and US features (upper pole location) were independent predictive factors for lateral LNM in a multivariate analysis with odds ratios of 18.144 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.999-164.664; P = 0.01), 8.582 (95% CI, 1.014-76.662; P = 0.049) and 9.576 (95% CI, 1.374-66.728; P = 0.023), respectively. Conclusions: BRAF mutation-positive PTMCs were more likely to manifest aggressive characteristics (extrathyroidal extension and LNM). The BRAF mutation screening of FNAB specimens can be used to predict aggressive clinicopathological characteristics of PTMC.

  {"id":"linDeepLearningFast2021","abstract":"<p>Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer in the endocrine system, and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most prevalent type of thyroid cancer, accounting for 70 to 80% of all thyroid cancer cases. In clinical practice, visual inspection of cytopathological slides is an essential initial method used by the pathologist to diagnose PTC. Manual visual assessment of the whole slide images is difficult, time consuming, and subjective, with a high inter-observer variability, which can sometimes lead to suboptimal patient management due to false-positive and false-negative. In this study, we present a fully automatic, efficient, and fast deep learning framework for fast screening of papanicolaou-stained thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) and ThinPrep (TP) cytological slides. To the authors’ best of knowledge, this work is the first study to build an automated deep learning framework for identification of PTC from both FNA and TP slides. The proposed deep learning framework is evaluated on a dataset of 131 WSIs, and the results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 99%, precision of 85%, recall of 94% and F1-score of 87% in segmentation of PTC in FNA slides and an accuracy of 99%, precision of 97%, recall of 98%, F1-score of 98%, and Jaccard-Index of 96% in TP slides. In addition, the proposed method significantly outperforms the two state-of-the-art deep learning methods, i.e., U-Net and SegNet, in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-score, and Jaccard-Index (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, for run-time analysis, the proposed fast screening method takes 0.4 min to process a WSI and is 7.8 times faster than U-Net and 9.1 times faster than SegNet, respectively.</p>","author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Yi-Jia"},{"family":"Chao","given":"Tai-Kuang"},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Muhammad-Adil"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yu-Ching"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Ding-Zhi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jia-Jhen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ching-Wei"}],"citation-key":"linDeepLearningFast2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13153891","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,2]]},"page":"3891","publisher":"MDPI AG","title":"Deep Learning Fast Screening Approach on Cytological Whole Slides for Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/15/3891","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"linGeneratingMultimodalArtificial2024","abstract":"Background: Machine learning has been increasingly used to develop algorithms that can improve medical diagnostics and prognostication and has shown promise in improving the classification of thyroid ultrasound images. This proof-of-concept study aims to develop a multimodal machine-learning model to classify follicular carcinoma from adenoma. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with follicular adenoma or carcinoma at a single institution between 2010 and 2022. Demographics, imaging, and perioperative variables were collected. The region of interest was annotated on ultrasound and used to perform radiomics analysis. Imaging features and clinical variables were then used to create a random forest classifier to predict malignancy. Leave-one-out cross-validation was conducted to evaluate classifier performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: Patients with follicular adenomas (n = 7) and carcinomas (n = 11) with complete imaging and perioperative data were included. A total of 910 features were extracted from each image. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding method reduced the dimension to 2 primary represented components. The random forest classifier achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (clinical only), 0.29 (image only), and 0.79 (multimodal data). Conclusion: Our multimodal machine learning model demonstrates promising results in classifying follicular carcinoma from adenoma. This approach can potentially be applied in future studies to generate models for preoperative differentiation of follicular thyroid neoplasms.","author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Ann C."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zelong"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Justine"},{"family":"Ranvier","given":"Gustavo Fernandez"},{"family":"Taye","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Owen","given":"Randall"},{"family":"Matteson","given":"David S."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Denise"}],"citation-key":"linGeneratingMultimodalArtificial2024","container-title":"Surgery (United States)","DOI":"10.1016/j.surg.2023.06.053","ISSN":"15327361","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"121-127","PMID":"37925261","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","title":"Generating a multimodal artificial intelligence model to differentiate benign and malignant follicular neoplasms of the thyroid: A proof-of-concept study","type":"article-journal","volume":"175"},
  {"id":"lingIdentificationCTbasedNoninvasive2023","abstract":"This study addresses the limited non-invasive tools for Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) survival prediction by identifying Computed Tomography (CT)-based biomarkers to improve prognosis prediction. A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from 149 OSCC patients, including CT radiomics and clinical information. An ensemble approach involving correlation analysis, score screening, and the Sparse-L1 algorithm was used to select functional features, which were then used to build Cox Proportional Hazards models (CPH). Our CPH achieved a 0.70 concordance index in testing. The model identified two CT-based radiomics features, Gradient-Neighboring-Gray-Tone-Difference-Matrix-Strength (GNS) and normalized-Wavelet-LLL-Gray-Level-Dependence-Matrix-Large-Dependence-High-Gray-Level-Emphasis (HLE), as well as stage and alcohol usage, as survival biomarkers. The GNS group with values above 14 showed a hazard ratio of 0.12 and a 3-year survival rate of about 90%. Conversely, the GNS group with values less than or equal to 14 had a 49% survival rate. For normalized HLE, the high-end group (HLE > − 0.415) had a hazard ratio of 2.41, resulting in a 3-year survival rate of 70%, while the low-end group (HLE ≤ − 0.415) had a 36% survival rate. These findings contribute to our knowledge of how radiomics can be used to predict the outcome so that treatment plans can be tailored for patients people with OSCC to improve their survival.","author":[{"family":"Ling","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Alexander","given":"Gregory S."},{"family":"Molitoris","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Jinhyuk"},{"family":"Schumaker","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Mehra","given":"Ranee"},{"family":"Gaykalova","given":"Daria A."},{"family":"Ren","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"lingIdentificationCTbasedNoninvasive2023","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-023-48048-x","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"PMID":"38066047","publisher":"Nature Research","title":"Identification of CT-based non-invasive radiomic biomarkers for overall survival prediction in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

However, preoperative risk assessment of PTC is still a challenge in the worldwide. Here, we first report a Preoperative Risk Assessment Classifier for PTC (PRAC-PTC) by multidimensional features including clinical indicators, immune indices, genetic feature, and proteomics. The 558 patients collected from June 2013 to November 2020 were allocated to three groups: discovery set (274 patients, 274 FFPE), retrospective test set (166 patients, 166 FFPE) and prospective test set (118 patients, 118 FNA). Proteomic profiling was conducted by formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) tissues from the patients. Preoperative clinical information and blood immunological indices were collected. The BRAFV600E mutation were detected by the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). We developed a machine learning model of 17 variables based on multidimensional features of 274 PTC patients from a retrospective cohort. The PRAC-PTC achieved areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.925 in the discovery set and validated externally by blinded analyses in a retrospective cohort of 166 PTC patients (0.787 AUC) and a prospective cohort of 118 PTC patients (0.799 AUC) from two independent clinical centres. Meanwhile, the preoperative predictive risk effectiveness of clinicians was improved with the assistance of PRAC-PTC, and the accuracies reached at 84.4% (95% CI 82.9-84.4) and 83.5% (95% CI 82.2-84.2) in the retrospective and prospective test sets, respectively. This study demonstrated that the PRAC-PTC that integrating clinical data, gene mutation information, immune indices, high-throughput proteomics and machine learning technology in multi-centre retrospective and prospective clinical cohorts can effectively stratify the preoperative risk of PTC and may decrease unnecessary surgery or overtreatment.

However, when the network is deeper and more complex, unpleasant artifacts can result. Through a lot of experiments, we can use the ESRGAN model to avoid such problems. When using the ESRGAN model for super-resolution reconstruction, the perceived index of the resulting results does not reach a lower value. There are two reasons for this: (1)ESRGAN does not expand the feature maping. ESRGAN uses 128∗128 to obtain the feature information of the image by default, and can't get more image information better. (2) ESRGAN did not re-optimize the generated image. Therefore, we propose ESRGAN-Pro to optimize ESRGAN for the above two aspects, combined with a large amount of training data, and get a better perception index and texture.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Shenghao"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Jinfang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jianqiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaoying"}],"citation-key":"liSingleImageSuper2019","DOI":"10.1117/12.2539692","ISBN":"978-1-5106-3075-8","ISSN":"1996756X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,21]]},"page":"69","publisher":"SPIE-Intl Soc Optical Eng","title":"Single image super resolution based on generative adversarial networks","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"liuAutomatedDetectionClassification2019","abstract":"Accurate diagnosis of thyroid nodules using ultrasonography is a valuable but tough task even for experienced radiologists, considering both benign and malignant nodules have heterogeneous appearances. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods could potentially provide objective suggestions to assist radiologists. However, the performance of existing learning-based approaches is still limited, for direct application of general learning models often ignores critical domain knowledge related to the specific nodule diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel deep-learning-based CAD system, guided by task-specific prior knowledge, for automated nodule detection and classification in ultrasound images. Our proposed CAD system consists of two stages. First, a multi-scale region-based detection network is designed to learn pyramidal features for detecting nodules at different feature scales. The region proposals are constrained by the prior knowledge about size and shape distributions of real nodules. Then, a multi-branch classification network is proposed to integrate multi-view diagnosis-oriented features, in which each network branch captures and enhances one specific group of characteristics that were generally used by radiologists. We evaluated and compared our method with the state-of-the-art CAD methods and experienced radiologists on two datasets, i.e. Dataset I and Dataset II. The detection and diagnostic accuracy on Dataset I were 97.5% and 97.1%, respectively. Besides, our CAD system also achieved better performance than experienced radiologists on Dataset II, with improvements of accuracy for 8%. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is effective in the discrimination of thyroid nodules.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Tianjiao"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Qianqian"},{"family":"Lian","given":"Chunfeng"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Xuhua"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Shujun"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Lijuan"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Weidong"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Dinggang"}],"citation-key":"liuAutomatedDetectionClassification2019","container-title":"Medical Image Analysis","DOI":"10.1016/j.media.2019.101555","ISSN":"13618415","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"page":"101555","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Automated detection and classification of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images using clinical-knowledge-guided convolutional neural networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361841519300970","volume":"58"},

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.","author":[{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Su-In"}],"citation-key":"lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,22]]},"title":"A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874"},

Design: Cohort study. Setting: National birth cohort and health registers. Patient(s): A total of 15,763 mothers and children from the Danish National Birth Cohort and its Puberty Cohort. Intervention(s): Register-based and self-reported information on maternal thyroid diseases during pregnancy (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, benign goiter, or no thyroid disease [reference group]). Main Outcome Measure(s): The adjusted mean age difference (months) at attaining several self-reported pubertal milestones collected every 6 months using an interval-censored regression and the average difference in age at attaining all pubertal milestones using the Huber-White robust variance estimation (primary outcome). Result(s): Sons of mothers with hyperthyroidism had earlier pubertal development (average difference, −2.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), −5.0 to −0.7] months) than unexposed sons. Maternal hypothyroidism was not associated with pubertal development in sons (average difference, −1.2 [95% CI, −5.1 to 2.7] months). We observed nonstatistically significant indications of earlier pubertal development in sons of mothers with benign goiter (average difference, −1.9 [95% CI, −4.6 to 0.9] months).

  {"id":"luoEarlyFaultDetection2018","abstract":"In modern digital manufacturing, nearly 79.6% of the downtime of a machine tool is caused by its mechanical failures. Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a useful way to minimize the machine downtime and the associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is early fault detection under time-varying operational conditions, which means mining sensitive fault features from condition signals in long-term running. However, fault features are often weakened and disturbed by the time-varying harmonics and noise during a machining process. Existing analysis methods of these complex and diverse data are inefficient and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel method for early fault detection under time-varying conditions. In this study, a deep learning model is constructed to automatically select the impulse responses from the vibration signals in long-term running of 288 days. Then, dynamic properties are identified from the selected impulse responses to detect the early mechanical fault under time-varying conditions. Compared to traditional methods, the experimental results in this paper have proved that our method was not affected by time-varying conditions and showed considerable potential for early fault detection in manufacturing.","author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haoting"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hongqi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Fangyu"}],"citation-key":"luoEarlyFaultDetection2018","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","DOI":"10.1109/TIE.2018.2807414","ISSN":"02780046","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"page":"509-518","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","title":"Early Fault Detection of Machine Tools Based on Deep Learning and Dynamic Identification","type":"article-journal","volume":"66"},
  {"id":"luReviewRoleUltrasound2022","abstract":"The incidence of thyroid disease has gradually increased in recent years. Conventional ultrasound is one of the most critical thyroid imaging methods, but it still has certain limitations. The use of B-model ultrasound (BMUS) diagnosis of thyroid disease will be affected by a doctors’ clinical experience. The ultrasound radiomics is based on ultrasound images to delineate the region of interest (ROI), and then extract features to quantify the disease information contained in the image, which helps to analyze the correlation between the image and the clinical pathology of the disease. By building a powerful model, it can be used to diagnose benign and malignant thyroid nodules, predict lymph node status in thyroid cancer, analyze molecular biological characteristics, and predict the survival of thyroid cancer patients. At present, the application of ultrasound radiomics in the thyroid is pervasive. These ultrasound radiomics studies have further promoted the progress of ultrasonic technology in the field of thyroid disease. Clinicians should be familiar with the workflow of ultrasound radiomics and understand the application of this technology to the thyroid. In this article, we first describe the workflow of ultrasound radiomics, followed by an overview of the application of ultrasound radiomics to the thyroid.

  {"id":"mahjabeenSystematicReviewAutomated","abstract":"This systematic review investigates the role of automated lymph node detection methods, particularly within the context of head and neck cancer diagnosis and treatment. Lymph node metastasis is a crucial factor in the staging and management of head and neck cancer patients, and the accuracy of lymph node assessment significantly influences treatment decisions and patient outcomes. Automated methods, especially those based on deep learning, have emerged as potential game-changers in enhancing the precision and efficiency of lymph node evaluation in medical imaging. Following PRISMA guidelines, this review presents a meticulous selection and analysis of relevant studies from peer-reviewed journals. It evaluates the clinical significance, performance metrics, limitations, and challenges of automated lymph node detection methods. Clinical relevance is a central theme, emphasizing these methods' critical role in aiding clinicians in lymph node assessment, influencing treatment planning, and improving patient care. Performance evaluation indicates that deep learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), exhibit impressive accuracy across various imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). However, the review also highlights persistent challenges, including high computational demands, false positives/negatives, and the need for seamless integration into clinical workflows. Standardization efforts through benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics are essential for future advancements. Addressing computational resource constraints, refining algorithms, and ensuring practical clinical implementation is essential for fully realizing the potential of automated lymph node detection in the management of head and neck cancer. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and clinicians seeking to navigate this evolving landscape.","author":[{"family":"Mahjabeen","given":"Nasira"},{"family":"Gampala","given":"Veerraju"}],"citation-key":"mahjabeenSystematicReviewAutomated","ISBN":"2147-67992","issue":"12s","page":"672-685","title":"A Systematic Review of Automated Lymph Node Detection Methods in Head and Neck Cancer: Clinical Significance, Performance, and Challenges","type":"report","URL":"www.ijisae.org","volume":"2024"},

  {"id":"maoSurgicalMethodsSocial2022","abstract":"Background: This study aimed to establish and verify an effective machine learning (ML) model to predict the prognosis of follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), and compare it with the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) model. Methods: Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to analyze the risk factors of cancer-specific survival (CSS). Propensity-score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the confounding factors of different surgeries. Nine different ML algorithms,including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Random Forests (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),were used to build prognostic models of FTC.10-fold cross-validation and SHapley Additive exPlanations were used to train and visualize the optimal ML model.The AJCC model was built by multivariate Cox regression and visualized through nomogram. The performance of the XGBoost model and AJCC model was mainly assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). Results: Multivariate Cox regression showed that age, surgical methods, marital status, T classification, N classification and M classification were independent risk factors of CSS. Among different surgeries, the prognosis of one-sided thyroid lobectomy plus isthmectomy (LO plus IO) was the best, followed by total thyroidectomy (hazard ratios: One-sided thyroid LO plus IO, 0.086[95% confidence interval (CI),0.025-0.290], P<0.001; total thyroidectomy (TT), 0.490[95%CI,0.295-0.814], P=0.006). PSM analysis proved that one-sided thyroid LO plus IO, TT, and partial thyroidectomy had no significant differences in long-term prognosis. Our study also revealed that married patients had better prognosis than single, widowed and separated patients (hazard ratios: single, 1.686[95%CI,1.146-2.479], P=0.008; widowed, 1.671[95%CI,1.163-2.402], P=0.006; separated, 4.306[95%CI,2.039-9.093], P<0.001). Among different ML algorithms, the XGBoost model had the best performance, followed by Gaussian NB, RF, LR, MLP, LightGBM, AdaBoost, KNN and SVM. In predicting FTC prognosis, the predictive performance of the XGBoost model was relatively better than the AJCC model (AUROC: 0.886 vs. 0.814). Conclusion: For high-risk groups, effective surgical methods and well marital status can improve the prognosis of FTC. Compared with the traditional AJCC model, the XGBoost model has relatively better prediction accuracy and clinical usage.","author":[{"family":"Mao","given":"Yaqian"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yanling"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Lizhen"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jixing"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Huibin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Liantao"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Junping"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Gang"}],"citation-key":"maoSurgicalMethodsSocial2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.816427","ISSN":"2234943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Surgical Methods and Social Factors Are Associated With Long-Term Survival in Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma: Construction and Validation of a Prognostic Model Based on Machine Learning Algorithms","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"maoucheExplainableAIApproach2023","abstract":"Objective: Breast Cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the first cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. In 90% of the cases, mortality is related to distant metastasis. Computer-aided prognosis systems using machine learning models have been widely used to predict breast cancer metastasis. Despite that, these systems still face several challenges. First, the models are generally biased toward the majority class due to datasets unbalance. Second, their increased complexity is associated with decreased interpretability which causes clinicians to distrust their prognosis. Methods: To tackle these issues, we have proposed an explainable approach for predicting breast cancer metastasis using clinicopathological data. Our approach is based on cost-sensitive CatBoost classifier and utilises LIME explainer to provide patient-level explanations. Results: We used a public dataset of 716 breast cancer patients to assess our approach. The results demonstrate the superiority of cost-sensitive CatBoost in precision (76.5%), recall (79.5%), and f1-score (77%) over classical and boosting models. The LIME explainer was used to quantify the impact of patient and treatment characteristics on breast cancer metastasis, revealing that they have different impacts ranging from high impact like the non-use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and moderate impact including carcinoma with medullary features histological type, to low impact like oral contraception use. The code is available at https://github.com/IkramMaouche/CS-CatBoost Conclusion: Our approach serves as a first step toward introducing more efficient and explainable computer-aided prognosis systems for breast cancer metastasis prediction.

  {"id":"masudaMachineLearningIdentify2021","abstract":"Introduction: We compared the diagnostic performance of morphological methods such as the major axis, the minor axis, the volume and sphericity and of machine learning with texture analysis in the identification of lymph node metastasis in patients with thyroid cancer who had undergone contrast-enhanced CT studies. Methods: We sampled 772 lymph nodes with histology defined tissue types (84 metastatic and 688 benign lymph nodes) that were visualised on CT images of 117 patients. A support vector machine (SVM), free programming software (Python), and the scikit-learn machine learning library were used to discriminate metastatic-from benign lymph nodes. We assessed 96 texture and 4 morphological features (major axis, minor axis, volume, sphericity) that were reported useful for the differentiation between metastatic and benign lymph nodes on CT images. The area under the curve (AUC) obtained by receiver operating characteristic analysis of univariate logistic regression and SVM classifiers were calculated for the training and testing datasets. Results: The AUC for all classifiers in training and testing datasets was 0.96 and 0.86, at the SVM for machine learning. When we applied conventional methods to the training and testing datasets, the AUCs were 0.63 and 0.48 for the major axis, 0.70 and 0.44 for the minor axis, 0.66 and 0.43 for the volume, and 0.69 and 0.54 for sphericity, respectively. The SVM using texture features yielded significantly higher AUCs than univariate logistic regression models using morphological features (p = 0.001). Conclusion: For the identification of metastatic lymph nodes from thyroid cancer on contrast-enhanced CT images, machine learning combined with texture analysis was superior to conventional diagnostic methods with the morphological parameters. Implications for practice: Our findings suggest that in patients with thyroid cancer and suspected lymph node metastasis who undergo contrast-enhanced CT studies, machine learning using texture analysis is high diagnostic value for the identification of metastatic lymph nodes.","author":[{"family":"Masuda","given":"T."},{"family":"Nakaura","given":"T."},{"family":"Funama","given":"Y."},{"family":"Sugino","given":"K."},{"family":"Sato","given":"T."},{"family":"Yoshiura","given":"T."},{"family":"Baba","given":"Y."},{"family":"Awai","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"masudaMachineLearningIdentify2021","container-title":"Radiography","DOI":"10.1016/j.radi.2021.03.001","ISSN":"10788174","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"page":"920-926","publisher":"W.B.

Methods In a prospective study performed between January 2007 and December 2009, 74 patients with a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy were referred to our institution for surgery. Preoperative assessment of metastasis in the central and lateral cervical lymph nodes was done using [18F]- fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose- positron emission tomography/ computed tomography, ultrasonography, and enhanced computed tomography. The results for each level of cervical node assessed using these methods were correlated with the pathology reports after surgery. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy of the three methods for all levels of cervical lymph node. Results There were no significant differences in the diagnostic results obtained by [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose- positron emission tomography/computed tomography and enhanced computed tomography. However, ultrasonography images gave significantly better results than either [ 18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography or enhanced computed tomography alone in identifying metastases on the basis of the level of cervical lymph node. In addition, the overall diagnostic accuracy tended to be higher for the lateral compartment than for the central compartment.

It has been reported that the existing approach to diagnosing TC is problematic. Therefore, it is essential to develop molecular biomarkers to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. This study aimed to screen hub lncRNAs in the ceRNA network (ceRNET) connected to TC formation and progression based on the overall survival rate. In this study, first, RNA-seq data from the GDC database were collected. A package called edgeR in R programming language was then used to obtain differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and mRNAs (DEmRNAs) in TC patients' samples compared to normal samples. Second, DEmRNAs were analyzed for their functional enrichment. Third, to identify RNAs associated with overall survival, the overall survival of these RNAs was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier plotter database to create a survival associated with the ceRNA network (survival-related ceRNET). Next, the GeneMANIA plugin was used to construct a PPI network to better understand survival-related DEmRNA interactions. The survival ceRNET was then visualized with the Cytoscape software, and hub genes, including hub lncRNAs and hub mRNAs, were identified using the CytoHubba plugin. We found 45 DElncRNAs, 28 DEmiRNAs, and 723 DEmRNAs among thyroid tumor tissue and non-tumor tissue samples. According to KEGG, GO and DO analyses, 723 DEmRNAs were mainly enriched in cancer-related pathways. Importantly, the results found that ten DElncRNAs, four DEmiRNAs, and 68 DEmRNAs are associated with overall survival. In this account, the PPI network was constructed for 68 survival-related DEmRNAs, and ADAMTS9, DTX4, and CLDN10 were identified as hub genes. The ceRNET was created by combining six lncRNAs, 109 miRNAs, and 22 mRNAs related to survival using Cytoscape. in this network, ten hub RNAs were identified by the CytoHubba plugin, including mRNAs (CTXND1, XKRX, IGFBP2, ENTPD1, GALNT7, ADAMTS9) and lncRNAs (AC090673.1, AL162511.1, LINC02454, AL365259.1). This study suggests that three lncRNAs, including AL162511.1, AC090673.1, and AL365259.1, could be reliable diagnostic biomarkers for TC.

Machine learning and feature selection algorithms (namely, Fisher’s discriminant ratio, Kruskal-Wallis’ analysis, and Relief-F) have been combined in this research to analyse a SEER database containing clinical features from de-identified thyroid cancer patients. The data covered 34 unique clinical variables such as patients’ age at diagnosis or information regarding lymph nodes, which were employed to build various novel classifiers to distinguish patients that lived for over 10 years since diagnosis, from those who did not survive at least five years. By properly optimizing supervised neural networks, specifically multilayer perceptrons, using data from large groups of thyroid cancer patients (between 6,756 and 20,344 for different models), we demonstrate that unspecialized and existing medical recording can be reliably turned into power of prediction to help doctors make informed and optimized treatment decisions, as distinguishing patients in terms of prognosis has been achieved with 94.5% accuracy. We also envisage the potential of applying our machine learning strategy to other diseases and purposes such as in designing clinical trials for unmasking the maximum benefits and minimizing risks associated with new drug candidates on given populations.","author":[{"family":"Mourad","given":"Moustafa"},{"family":"Moubayed","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Dezube","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Mourad","given":"Youssef"},{"family":"Park","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Torreblanca-Zanca","given":"Albertina"},{"family":"Torrecilla","given":"José S."},{"family":"Cancilla","given":"John C."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiwu"}],"citation-key":"mouradMachineLearningFeature2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-62023-w","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"PMID":"32198433","publisher":"Nature Research","title":"Machine Learning and Feature Selection Applied to SEER Data to Reliably Assess Thyroid Cancer Prognosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"muMappingGlobalEpidemiology2022","abstract":"Introduction: An emerging public health issue is brought on by the worldwide increase of thyroid nodules (TNs). The goal of the current study is to determine the global prevalence of TNs among the general population. Methods: We screened articles published from January 2000 to May 2022. TN prevalence was calculated with the DerSimonian–Laird random effects model with arcsine transformation. Results: A total of 20,358 entries were found in our research, and 102 of them met our inclusion criteria. A total of 9,276,178 individuals have been diagnosed as TNs; the overall prevalence was 24.83% (95% CI 21.44–28.55), regardless of the diagnostic techniques. TNs have become more prevalent during 2012–2022 (29.29%) compared with 2000–2011 (21.53%, p = 0.02). In addition, we discovered that women (36.51%) were more likely to have TNs than men (23.47%, p < 0.01). Interestingly, we found that obesity was correlated with the prevalence of TNs. Additionally, age-specific-stratified TN prevalence was found in our results. Discussion: This meta-analysis shows that, regardless of country development and economic status, TNs are spreading more widely over the world. Our findings showed a strong correlation between rising TN prevalence and older age, female sex, and elevated weight. To stop the TN epidemic from spreading over the world, increased awareness, the understanding of the disease, and quick action are required.","author":[{"family":"Mu","given":"Chunyang"},{"family":"Ming","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Ye"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Menglin"},{"family":"Ni","given":"Yinyun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhihui"}],"citation-key":"muMappingGlobalEpidemiology2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.1029926","ISSN":"2234943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,10]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Mapping global epidemiology of thyroid nodules among general population: A systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"muPredictionCervicalLymph2024","abstract":"Objective: The accurate clinical diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis plays an important role in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). This study aimed to explore and summarize a more objective approach to detect cervical malignant lymph node metastasis of DTC via radiomics models. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for all eligible studies. Articles using radiomics models based on ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging to assess cervical lymph node metastasis preoperatively were included. Characteristics and diagnostic accuracy measures were extracted. Bias and applicability judgments were evaluated by the revised QUADAS-2 tool. The estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Additionally, the leave-one-out method was conducted to assess the heterogeneity. Results: Twenty-nine radiomics studies with 6160 validation set patients were included in the qualitative analysis, and 11 studies with 3863 validation set patients were included in the meta-analysis. Four of them had an external independent validation set. The studies were heterogeneous, and a significant risk of bias was found in 29 studies. Meta-analysis showed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis via US-based radiomics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91), respectively. Conclusions: Although radiomics-based models for cervical lymphatic metastasis in DTC have been demonstrated to have moderate diagnostic capabilities, broader data, standardized radiomics features, robust feature selection, and model exploitation are still needed in the future.

Challenges like inaccuracy in prognostication, uncertainty in cytopathological diagnosis, trouble in differentiating follicular neoplasms, intra-observer and inter-observer variability on ultrasound imaging preclude personalised treatment in thyroid cancer. Artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing a paradigm shift to the healthcare, powered by quick advancement of the analytic techniques. Several recent studies have shown remarkable progress in thyroid cancer diagnostics based on AI-assisted algorithms. Application of AI techniques in thyroid ultrasonography and cytopathology have shown remarkable impro-vement in sensitivity and specificity over the traditional diagnostic modalities. AI has also been explored in the development of treatment algorithms for indeterminate nodules and for prognostication in the patients with thyroid cancer. The benefits of high repeatability and straightforward implementation of AI in the management of thyroid cancer suggest that it holds promise for clinical application. Limited clinical experience and lack of prospective validation studies remain the biggest drawbacks.

  {"id":"namdeoThyroidDisorderDiagnosis2022","abstract":"The diagnosis of thyroid via appropriate interpretation of thyroid data is the vital classification issue. Only little contributions are made so far in the automatic diagnosis of thyroid disease. In order to solve Thyroid disorder this paper intends to propose a new thyroid diagnosis model, utilising two-phases includes Feature Extraction and Classification. In the first phase, two sorts of features are extracted that include image features like neighbourhood-based and gradient features, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the data features as well. Subsequently, two sorts of classification processes are performed. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for image classification by extracting deep features. Neural Network (NN) is used for classifying the disease by obtaining both the image and data features as the input. Finally, both the classified results (CNN and NN) are combined to increase the accuracy rate of diagnosis. Further, as the main aim of this work is to increase the accuracy rate, this paper aims to trigger the optimisation concept. The convolutional layer of CNN is optimally selected, and while classifying under NN the given features should be the optimal one. Hence, the required features are optimally selected. For these optimisations, a new modified algorithm is proposed in this work namely Worst Fitness-based Cuckoo Search (WF-CS) which is the modified form of Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CS). Finally, the performance of proposed WF-CS is compared over other conventional methods like Conventional CS, Genetic Algorithm (GA), FireFly (FF), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and proves the superiority of proposed work in detecting the presence of thyroid.","author":[{"family":"Namdeo","given":"Rajole Bhausaheb"},{"family":"Janardan","given":"Gond Vitthal"}],"citation-key":"namdeoThyroidDisorderDiagnosis2022","container-title":"Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1080/0952813X.2021.1938694","ISSN":"13623079","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"871-890","publisher":"Taylor and Francis Ltd.","title":"Thyroid Disorder Diagnosis by Optimal Convolutional Neuron based CNN Architecture","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},

Invasion is the first step in the metastatic cascade, when tumour cells acquire the ability to move, penetrate into the surrounding tissue and enter lymphatic and blood vessels in order to disseminate. A role for genetic alterations in invasion is not universally accepted, with sceptics arguing that cellular motility is related only to external factors such as hypoxia, chemoattractants and the rigidity of the extracellular matrix. However, increasing evidence shows that mutations might trigger and accelerate the migration and invasion of different types of cancer cells.

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the number of patients with thyroid cancer (TC) has become a concern, necessitating a proactive system that can help cut down the incidence of this disease, where the system can assist in early interventions to prevent or cure the disease. In this paper, we introduce our work developing machine learning-based tools that can serve as early warning systems by detecting TC at very early stages (pre-symptomatic stage). In addition, we aimed at obtaining the greatest possible accuracy while using fewer features. It must be noted that while there have been past efforts to use machine learning in predicting TC, this is the first attempt using a Saudi Arabian dataset as well as targeting diagnosis in the pre-symptomatic stage (pre-emptive diagnosis). The techniques used in this work include random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and naïve Bayes (NB), each of which was selected for their unique capabilities. The highest accuracy rate obtained was 90.91% with the RF technique, while SVM, ANN, and NB achieved 84.09%, 88.64%, and 81.82% accuracy, respectively. These levels were obtained by using only seven features out of an available 15.

Design A retrospective population-based study conducted using the National Cancer Database from 2000-2013 (NCDB). Demographics of patients presenting with stage IV thyroid cancer were compared to patients presenting with all other stages using the chi-square testing. The incidence rates were examined with the trend graphs. Results When compared to stages I-III, there was an increased incidence of stage IV thyroid cancer in: Medicare, lower level of education, lower income, advanced age, male sex, increased number of comorbidities, further distance from a treatment facility, and medullary/anaplastic histology. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 7.1 per 100,000 in 2000 to 17.6 per 100,000 in 2013. During this same time period, stage IV disease increased 1 per 100,000. The increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer was almost entirely due to an increase in papillary cancer. Conclusions The United States has continued to see a rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the last decade, largely due to the detection of papillary cancers. During this same time, the incidence of stage IV thyroid cancer increased as well. Because early diagnosis and treatment of an increasing number of potentially lethal cancers should lead to a decrease in metastatic disease, we suggest that the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States is due to overdiagnosis and that more aggressive disease is not being removed by early detection.","author":[{"family":"Olson","given":"Evan"},{"family":"Wintheiser","given":"Grant"},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Katrina M"},{"family":"Droessler","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Silberstein","given":"Peter T"}],"citation-key":"olsonEpidemiologyThyroidCancer2019","container-title":"Cureus","DOI":"10.7759/cureus.4127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,24]]},"publisher":"Cureus, Inc.","title":"Epidemiology of Thyroid Cancer: A Review of the National Cancer Database, 2000-2013","type":"article-journal"},

Thus, there is a great demand for high-throughput identification of rare CTC clusters for prognostic diagnosis. Immunofluorescence staining is considered the gold standard for identifying CTCs. However, as CTC clusters are extremely heterogeneous cells, multiple staining markers are required for accurate discrimination. Additionally, the staining procedure is tedious and the analysis of large amounts of stained images is labor-intensive and error-prone. Recently, machine learning-based identification has been introduced to achieve accurate discrimination, but they still rely on immunofluorescence staining for dataset preparation. In this study, we developed a hybrid algorithm, a convolutional neural network support vector machine (CNN-SVM), for the accurate classification of CTC clusters without immunofluorescence staining. In dataset preparation, the Wright–Giemsa staining was used to highlight the morphological features of the cells. Four morphological characteristics that display the unique traits of cells were drawn with each eigenvector, as a result of learning, the algorithm classified CTC clusters of various configurations with a sensitivity and specificity of > 90%.

The Decision Tree model showed the best accuracy at 95%, and the lightGBM and stacking model together showed 93% accuracy. Among those factors mentioned above, LNR and contralateral LN metastasis were used as important features in all machine learning prediction models. We confirmed that all machine learning prediction models showed an accuracy of 90% or more for predicting disease recurrence in PTC. LNR and contralateral LN metastasis were used as important features for constructing a robust machine learning prediction model. In the future, we have a plan to perform large-scale multicenter clinical studies to improve the performance of our prediction models and verify their clinical effectiveness.</p>","author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Young Min"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Byung-Joo"}],"citation-key":"parkMachineLearningbasedPrediction2021","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-84504-2","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,2]]},"page":"4948","publisher":"Nature Research","title":"Machine learning-based prediction model using clinico-pathologic factors for papillary thyroid carcinoma recurrence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84504-2","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"pengDeepLearningbasedArtificial2021","abstract":"Background: Strategies for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into thyroid nodule management require additional development and testing. We developed a deep-learning AI model (ThyNet) to differentiate between malignant tumours and benign thyroid nodules and aimed to investigate how ThyNet could help radiologists improve diagnostic performance and avoid unnecessary fine needle aspiration. Methods: ThyNet was developed and trained on 18 049 images of 8339 patients (training set) from two hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China) and tested on 4305 images of 2775 patients (total test set) from seven hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China; the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the Guangzhou Army General Hospital, Guangzhou, China; the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; and the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China) in three stages. All nodules in the training and total test set were pathologically confirmed. The diagnostic performance of ThyNet was first compared with 12 radiologists (test set A); a ThyNet-assisted strategy, in which ThyNet assisted diagnoses made by radiologists, was developed to improve diagnostic performance of radiologists using images (test set B); the ThyNet assisted strategy was then tested in a real-world clinical setting (using images and videos; test set C). In a simulated scenario, the number of unnecessary fine needle aspirations avoided by ThyNet-assisted strategy was calculated. Findings: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for accurate diagnosis of ThyNet (0·922 [95% CI 0·910–0·934]) was significantly higher than that of the radiologists (0·839 [0·834–0·844]; p<0·0001). Furthermore, ThyNet-assisted strategy improved the pooled AUROC of the radiologists from 0·837 (0·832–0·842) when diagnosing without ThyNet to 0·875 (0·871–0·880; p<0·0001) with ThyNet for reviewing images, and from 0·862 (0·851–0·872) to 0·873 (0·863–0·883; p<0·0001) in the clinical test, which used images and videos. In the simulated scenario, the number of fine needle aspirations decreased from 61·9% to 35·2% using the ThyNet-assisted strategy, while missed malignancy decreased from 18·9% to 17·0%. Interpretation: The ThyNet-assisted strategy can significantly improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists and help reduce unnecessary fine needle aspirations for thyroid nodules.

Systematic reviews answer pre-defined research questions using explicit, reproducible methods to identify, critically appraise and combine results of primary research studies. Key stages in the production of systematic reviews include clarification of aims and methods in a protocol, finding relevant research, collecting data, assessing study quality, synthesizing evidence, and interpreting findings. Systematic reviews may address different types of questions, such as questions about effectiveness of interventions, diagnostic test accuracy, prognosis, prevalence or incidence of disease, accuracy of measurement instruments, or qualitative data. For all reviews, it is important to define criteria such as the population, intervention, comparison and outcomes, and to identify potential risks of bias. Reviews of the effect of rehabilitation interventions or reviews of data from observational studies, diagnostic test accuracy, or qualitative data may be more methodologically challenging than reviews of effectiveness of drugs for the prevention or treatment of stroke. Challenges in reviews of stroke rehabilitation can include poor definition of complex interventions, use of outcome measures that have not been validated, and poor generalizability of results. There may also be challenges with bias because the effects are dependent on the persons delivering the intervention, and because masking of participants and investigators may not be possible.

  {"id":"poonMutationSignaturesCarcinogen2014","abstract":"Exposure to environmental mutagens is an important cause of human cancer, and measures to reduce mutagenic and carcinogenic exposures have been highly successful at controlling cancer. Until recently, it has been possible to connect the chemical characteristics of mutagens to actual mutations observed in human tumors only indirectly. Now, next-generation sequencing technology enables us to observe in detail the DNA-sequence-level effects of well-known mutagens, such as ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke, as well as endogenous mutagenic processes, such as those involving activated DNA cytidine deaminases (APOBECs). We can also observe the effects of less well-known but potent mutagens, including those recently found to be present in some herbal remedies. Crucially, we can now tease apart the superimposed effects of several mutational exposures and processes and determine which ones occurred during the development of individual tumors. Here, we review advances in detecting these mutation signatures and discuss the implications for surveillance and prevention of cancer. The number of sequenced tumors from diverse cancer types and multiple geographic regions is growing explosively, and the genomes of these tumors will bear the signatures of even more diverse mutagenic exposures. Thus, we envision development of wide-ranging compendia of mutation signatures from tumors and a concerted effort to experimentally elucidate the signatures of a large number of mutagens. This information will be used to link signatures observed in tumors to the exposures responsible for them, which will offer unprecedented opportunities for prevention. © 2014 Poon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Poon","given":"Song L."},{"family":"McPherson","given":"John R."},{"family":"Tan","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Teh","given":"Bin T."},{"family":"Rozen","given":"Steven G."}],"citation-key":"poonMutationSignaturesCarcinogen2014","container-title":"Genome Medicine","DOI":"10.1186/gm541","ISSN":"1756994X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,31]]},"publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Mutation signatures of carcinogen exposure: Genome-wide detection and new opportunities for cancer prevention","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

Methods: US imaging features of 1141 thyroid nodules (shape, echogenicity, pattern of blood flow, presence of microcalcifications and the presence of other nodules in the thyroid) and their palpability were compared with the post-operative histopathological outcomes. The efficacy of the selected sets of the features was assessed for small nodules (SN)≤15 mm and large nodules (LN)>15 mm, as well as separately for nodules≤10 mm. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that in SN hypoechogenicity (odds ratios, OR: 3.18), microcalcifications (OR: 19.12), solitary occurrence (OR: 3.29) and height-to-width ratio≥1 (OR: 8.57) were independent risk factors for malignancy. The optimal set of small lesions that should be biopsied includes all lesions presenting at least one of the above-mentioned features (sensitivity 98%, specificity 44%). In the LN group, the selection criteria based on the shape of lesions and hypoechogenicity were less sensitive than in the SN group, but they allowed further reduction in the number of performed FNABs. Large nodules primarily selected for FNAB should be hypoechoic, more tall then wide or contain microcalcifications (sensitivity 84%, specificity 72%).

  {"id":"preteUpdateFundamentalMechanisms2020","abstract":"The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has increased worldwide over the past four decades. TC is divided into three main histological types: differentiated (papillary and follicular TC), undifferentiated (poorly differentiated and anaplastic TC), and medullary TC, arising from TC cells. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms associated to the pathogenesis of different types of TC and their clinical relevance. In the last years, progresses in the genetic characterization of TC have provided molecular markers for diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment targets. Recently, papillary TC, the most frequent form of TC, has been reclassified into two molecular subtypes, named BRAF-like and RAS-like, associated to a different range of cancer risks. Similarly, the genetic characterization of follicular TC has been proposed to complement the new histopathological classification in order to estimate the prognosis. New analyses characterized a comprehensive molecular profile of medullary TC, raising the role of RET mutations. More recent evidences suggested that immune microenvironment associated to TC may play a critical role in tumor invasion, with potential immunotherapeutic implications in advanced and metastatic TC. Several types of ancillary approaches have been developed to improve the diagnostic value of fine needle aspiration biopsies in indeterminate thyroid nodules. Finally, liquid biopsy, as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for body fluid genotyping, brings a new prospective of disease and therapy monitoring. Despite all these novelties, much work remains to be done to fully understand the pathogenesis and biological behaviors of the different types of TC and to transfer this knowledge in clinical practice.","author":[{"family":"Prete","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Borges de Souza","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Censi","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Muzza","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Nucci","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Sponziello","given":"Marialuisa"}],"citation-key":"preteUpdateFundamentalMechanisms2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2020.00102","ISSN":"16642392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,13]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Update on Fundamental Mechanisms of Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"prinziShallowDeepLearning2024","abstract":"An increasingly strong connection between artificial intelligence and medicine has enabled the development of predictive models capable of supporting physicians’ decision-making. Artificial intelligence encompasses much more than machine learning, which nevertheless is its most cited and used sub-branch in the last decade. Since most clinical problems can be modeled through machine learning classifiers, it is essential to discuss their main elements. This review aims to give primary educational insights on the most accessible and widely employed classifiers in radiology field, distinguishing between “shallow” learning (i.e., traditional machine learning) algorithms, including support vector machines, random forest and XGBoost, and “deep” learning architectures including convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. In addition, the paper outlines the key steps for classifiers training and highlights the differences between the most common algorithms and architectures. Although the choice of an algorithm depends on the task and dataset dealing with, general guidelines for classifier selection are proposed in relation to task analysis, dataset size, explainability requirements, and available computing resources. Considering the enormous interest in these innovative models and architectures, the problem of machine learning algorithms interpretability is finally discussed, providing a future perspective on trustworthy artificial intelligence. Relevance statement The growing synergy between artificial intelligence and medicine fosters predictive models aiding physicians. Machine learning classifiers, from shallow learning to deep learning, are offering crucial insights for the development of clinical decision support systems in healthcare. Explainability is a key feature of models that leads systems toward integration into clinical practice. Key points • Training a shallow classifier requires extracting disease-related features from region of interests (e.g., radiomics). • Deep classifiers implement automatic feature extraction and classification. • The classifier selection is based on data and computational resources availability, task, and explanation needs.

Methods: We constructed DL models with AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet. The models were trained separately with transfer learning. We measured each model’s performance with six indicators: recall, precision, negative predictive value (NPV), specificity, accuracy, and F1-score. We also compared the diagnostic performances of first- and third-year nuclear medicine (NM) residents with assistance from the best-performing DL-based model. The Kappa coefficient and average classification time of each model were compared with those of two NM residents. Results: The recall, precision, NPV, specificity, accuracy, and F1-score of the three models ranged from 73.33% to 97.00%. The Kappa coefficient of all three models was >0.710. All models performed better than the first-year NM resident but not as well as the third-year NM resident in terms of diagnostic ability.

In the internal test set [974 images (139 no gross ETE nodules and 83 gross ETE nodules)] and the external test set [563 images (95 no gross ETE nodules and 48 gross ETE nodules)], the diagnostic performance of DL model was verified based on the pathological results. And then, compared the results with the diagnosis by 2 senior and 2 junior radiologists. Findings: In the internal test set, DL model demonstrated the highest AUC (0.91; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.96), which was significantly higher than that of two senior radiologists [(AUC, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.85; P < 0.001) and (AUC, 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.83; P < 0.001)] and two juniors radiologists [(AUC, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.73; P < 0.001) and (AUC, 0.69; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.77; P < 0.001)]. DL model was significantly higher than clinical model [(AUC, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.89; P = 0.019)], but there was no significant difference between DL model and clinical and DL combined model [(AUC, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.97; P = 0.143)]. In the external test set, DL model also demonstrated the highest AUC (0.88, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94), which was significantly higher than that of one of senior radiologists [(AUC, 0.75; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.84; P = 0.008) and (AUC, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.89; P = 0.152)] and two junior radiologists [(AUC, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.81; P = 0.002) and (AUC, 0.67; 95 CI: 0.57, 0.77; P < 0.001]. There was no significant difference between DL model and clinical model [(AUC, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.91; P = 0.516)] and clinical + DL model [(AUC, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.96; P = 0.093)]. Using DL model, the diagnostic ability of two junior radiologists was significantly improved. Interpretation: The DL model based on ultrasound imaging is a simple and helpful tool for preoperative diagnosis of gross ETE thyroid cancer, and its diagnostic performance is equivalent to or even better than that of senior radiologists.

  {"id":"radhachandranMultitaskApproachAutomated2022","abstract":"Objective: Poor risk stratification of thyroid nodules by ultrasound has motivated the need for a deep learning-based approach for nodule segmentation. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of a multitask approach to detect ultrasounds containing potential nodules and segment nodules on the suspected images. Methods: Ultrasound studies were acquired from 280 patients at UCLA Health, totaling 9888 images. A novel anomaly detection (AD) module, to classify suspicious ultrasound images, was integrated with various state of the art segmentation architectures. The trained models were evaluated on a portion of the in-house dataset, as well as two external validation (EV) sets, to understand how the AD module affected segmentation performance. Results: The addition of AD to the architectures improved image-level nodule detection, evidenced by the increase in F1 scores and image-wide Dice similarity coefficient. Of the models with AD, MSUNet-AD had the highest F1 score of 0.829; however, there was a decrease in DSC on just images with nodules (DSC +) from 0.726 to 0.627. This drop was observed across all models when AD was added; however, closer analysis of DSC + by nodule size revealed that this difference was not significant in larger nodules, which are more likely to be clinically relevant. Finally, evaluation of MSUNet with and without AD on the EV datasets demonstrated comparable performance with the UCLA dataset. Conclusion: The proposed architecture is an automated multitask method that can both detect and segment nodules in ultrasound. Performance on the EV datasets demonstrates generalizability of the model.","author":[{"family":"Radhachandran","given":"Ashwath"},{"family":"Kinzel","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Sant","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Maitraya"},{"family":"Masamed","given":"Rinat"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Corey W"},{"family":"Speier","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"radhachandranMultitaskApproachAutomated2022","container-title":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","DOI":"10.1101/2023.01.31.23285223","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"1-10","title":"A Multitask Approach for Automated Detection and Segmentation of Thyroid Nodules in Ultrasound Images","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.31.23285223","volume":"2022"},
  {"id":"radovicMinimumRedundancyMaximum2017","abstract":"Background: Feature selection, aiming to identify a subset of features among a possibly large set of features that are relevant for predicting a response, is an important preprocessing step in machine learning. In gene expression studies this is not a trivial task for several reasons, including potential temporal character of data. However, most feature selection approaches developed for microarray data cannot handle multivariate temporal data without previous data flattening, which results in loss of temporal information. We propose a temporal minimum redundancy - maximum relevance (TMRMR) feature selection approach, which is able to handle multivariate temporal data without previous data flattening. In the proposed approach we compute relevance of a gene by averaging F-statistic values calculated across individual time steps, and we compute redundancy between genes by using a dynamical time warping approach. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on three temporal gene expression datasets from human viral challenge studies. Obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms alternatives widely used in gene expression studies. In particular, the proposed method achieved improvement in accuracy in 34 out of 54 experiments, while the other methods outperformed it in no more than 4 experiments. Conclusion: We developed a filter-based feature selection method for temporal gene expression data based on maximum relevance and minimum redundancy criteria. The proposed method incorporates temporal information by combining relevance, which is calculated as an average F-statistic value across different time steps, with redundancy, which is calculated by employing dynamical time warping approach. As evident in our experiments, incorporating the temporal information into the feature selection process leads to selection of more discriminative features.","author":[{"family":"Radovic","given":"Milos"},{"family":"Ghalwash","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Filipovic","given":"Nenad"},{"family":"Obradovic","given":"Zoran"}],"citation-key":"radovicMinimumRedundancyMaximum2017","container-title":"BMC Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/s12859-016-1423-9","ISSN":"14712105","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,3]]},"PMID":"28049413","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd.","title":"Minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection approach for temporal gene expression data","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of BMUS and CDUS in differentiating cervical lymph nodes into benign and malignant nature.  Methodology In this cross-sectional analytical study, a total of 166 patients, who were referred for US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of cervical nodes, were included. Patients with cystic/ necrotic cervical nodes or without FNAC/biopsy report were excluded. All study patients underwent BMUS and CDUS, followed by the reference investigation of FNAC/biopsy for analysis. In BMUS, short-axis diameter (SAD), short-axis/long-axis diameter ratio (S/L), presence or absence of echogenic hilum and well defined or ill-defined borders were analyzed. In CDUS, the vascular pattern of a cervical node was categorized as hilar, peripheral or mixed. In cases with multiple cervical lymph nodes, the node having the most suspicious features on the greyscale US was chosen. The results were compared with the final FNAC/biopsy reports. Results A total of 166 patients were analyzed in this study. The cut-off point of SAD and S/L ratio for the cervical lymph nodes was 1.28cm and 0.595. The S/L ratio was the best BMUS parameter with a sensitivity of 75%, the specificity of 81%, and an accuracy of 79%. Loss of echogenic hilum was the most sensitive parameter in this study with a sensitivity of 95.4% and an accuracy of 79.5%. The presence of ill-defined margins was significantly higher in the malignant nodes than the benign nodes with a p-value <0.001. The presence of peripheral/mixed vascularity was higher in the malignant nodes than the benign nodes with a p-value <0.001. Conclusions Malignant nodes had significantly higher SAD, higher S/L ratio, loss of echogenic hilum, presence of ill-defined margins and peripheral/mixed vascularity compared to benign nodes. The loss of echogenic hilum was the most accurate and sensitive parameter, while the S/L ratio was found to be the most specific BMUS parameter in the detection of malignant nodes.

  {"id":"ross2016AmericanThyroid2016","abstract":"Background: Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition. Methods: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group. Results: Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery.

No current biomarkers are able to predict metastatic lymphadenopathy and recurrence in early stage papillary thyroid cancer. Hence, identifying prognostic biomarkers predicting cervical lymph-node metastases would prove very helpful in determining treatment. Methods: The database of the Cancer Genome Atlas included 495 papillary thyroid cancer samples. Using this database, we developed a machine learning model to define a gene signature that could predict lymph-node metastasis (N0 or N1). Kruskal-Wallis tests, univariate and multivariate logistic and Cox regression models, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to correlate the gene signature with clinical outcomes. Results: We identified a panel of 25 genes and constructed a risk score that can differentiate N0 and N1 papillary thyroid cancer samples (P <.001) with a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 62%, a positive predictive value of 93%, and a negative predictive value of 42%.

Thyroid US is easily accessible, noninvasive, and cost-effective, and is a mandatory step in the workup of thyroid nodules. The main disadvantage of the method is that it is operator dependent. Thyroid US assessment of the risk of malignancy is crucial in patients with nodules, in order to select those who should have a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy performed. Due to the pivotal role of thyroid US in the management of patients with nodules, the European Thyroid Association convened a panel of international experts to set up European guidelines on US risk stratification of thyroid nodules.

  {"id":"russThyroidIncidentalomasEpidemiology2014","abstract":"? 2014 European Thyroid Association Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.A thyroid incidentaloma is an unexpected, asymptomatic thyroid tumor fortuitously discovered during the investigation of an unrelated condition. The prevalence rate is 67% with ultrasonography (US) imaging, 15% with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck, and 1-2% with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography. In the absence of a history of external beam radiation or familial medullary thyroid cancer, the risk of malignancy ranges between 5 and 13% when discovered with US, CT or MRI, but is much higher if based on focal FDG uptake (30%). All patients with a thyroid incidentaloma, independent of the mode of detection, should undergo a dedicated neck US with risk stratification: US imaging allows a quantitative risk stratification of malignancy in thyroid nodules, named 'reporting system' or 'TIRADS' (thyroid imaging reporting and data system). The reported sensitivity ranges from 87 to 95% for the detection of carcinomas and the neg-ative predictive value from 88 to 99.8%. We suggest that the indications for fine-needle aspiration be based mainly on size and US risk stratification. However, the diagnosis and workup of thyroid incidentalomas leads to superfluous surgery for benign conditions, and excess diagnosis and treatment of papillary microcarcinomas, the vast majority of which would cause no harm. Recognizing this must form the basis of any decision as to supplementary investigations and whether to offer therapy, in a close dialogue between patient and physician.

Methods: This prospective study included 550 consecutive patients with , thyroid nodules. Nodules were divided into two groups on the basis of pathological diagnosis: group 1 consisted of 1,633 nodules with a benign pathology, and group 2 consisted of 293 nodules with a malignant pathology. Results: Microcalcifications, blurred nodular margins, and solid and hypoechoic appearance were more common in malignant nodules compared to benign nodules (89.1% versus 5%; 64.5% versus 4.7%; 81.6% versus 30.6% ; and 62.5% versus 43.1%, respectively; p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the detection of malignant thyroid nodules and microcalcification (rs = 0.791, p = 0.0001), blurred nodular margin (rs = 0.625, p = 0.0001), solid appearance (rs = 0.376, p = 0.0001), and hypoechoic appearance (rs = 0.141, p = 0.0001). Microcalcifications, blurred nodular margins, and solid and hypoechoic appearance were independent determinants of malignancy upon US examination of thyroid nodules (OR: 159, OR: 37, OR: 9.9, and OR: 2.2, respectively). Conclusion: Although we did not identify a single feature indicative of malignancy in the sonographic examination of nodules, microcalcification and blurred margin were the strongest correlates for malignancy. © 2008 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.","author":[{"family":"Salmaslioǧlu","given":"Artür"},{"family":"Erbil","given":"Yeşim"},{"family":"Dural","given":"Cem"},{"family":"Işsever","given":"Halim"},{"family":"Kapran","given":"Yersu"},{"family":"Özarmaǧan","given":"Selçuk"},{"family":"Tezelman","given":"Serdar"}],"citation-key":"salmasliogluPredictiveValueSonographic2008","container-title":"World Journal of Surgery","DOI":"10.1007/s00268-008-9600-2","ISSN":"03642313","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9]]},"page":"1948-1954","PMID":"18443853","title":"Predictive value of sonographic features in preoperative evaluation of malignant thyroid nodules in a multinodular goiter","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"sarkarBenignThyroidDisease2006","abstract":"Nuclear medicine is directly involved in both the diagnosis and treatment of benign thyroid disease, which requires an understanding of the pathophysiology and management of thyroid disorders in addition to expertise in nuclear methodology. Thyroid uptake and imaging, the principal nuclear tests in thyroid disease, may be used as follows: (1) Differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism: A very low thyroid uptake suggests destructive (\"subacute\") thyroiditis, a self-limited disorder, whereas a normal or elevated uptake is consistent with toxic nodular goiter and Graves' disease. Scintigraphic characteristics also help differentiate between nodular and Graves' disease. (2) Function of thyroid nodules: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytological examination (FNAB) is used routinely to assess for malignancy in thyroid nodules. Scintigraphy may be of assistance before FNAB. \"Hot\" nodules are generally benign and do not require FNAB, while \"cold\" nodules may be malignant. (3) Differential diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism: Scintigraphy combined with ultrasound examination may be used to identify such conditions as thyroid agenesis, dyshormonogenesis, and incomplete thyroid descent. Treatment of Graves' disease and toxic nodular disease with 131I may require greater clinical involvement and decision analysis compared with thyroid uptake and imaging. The following aspects of treatment are particularly important: (1) Risk: Radioiodine treatment may occasionally aggravate hyperthyroidism, Graves' ophthalmopathy, and airway obstruction caused by large, nodular goiters. Alternative treatments, including the temporary use of antithyroid drugs, and surgery for nodular goiters, may be considered. (2) Radioiodine dose: Cure of hyperthyroidism with a single 131I treatment is desirable, though not always possible. Such factors as a large goiter, severe hyperthyroidism, and prior propylthiouracil therapy, may contribute to treatment failure. (3) Informed consent: A detailed discussion with the patient regarding the clinical risks, outcomes, and side effects of 131I is a critical component of successful management. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"shankThyroidCancerGlobal2022","abstract":"The incidence of thyroid cancer continues to increase, representing the 5th most common cancer type in the USA today (Sherman, Lancet 361(9356):501–11, 2003). The current study sought to analyze the global burden of thyroid cancer utilizing the publicly accessible GLOBOCAN database. An estimated 586,202 cases of thyroid cancer were reported in 2020, making thyroid cancer the 10th most common cancer worldwide. The majority of thyroid cancer cases occurred in countries with a high or very high Human Development Index (HDI), accounting for 91% of new cases. With respect to the World Health Organization (WHO) regions, the Western Pacific had the highest incidence of thyroid cancer accounting for 47.6% of cases despite representing only 25.4% of the world’s population. Thyroid cancer incidence and mortality are expected to increase by 29.9% and 67%, respectively, by the year 2040. The African region is projected to experience the highest increase in both incidence (84.3%) and mortality (100.3%) over this time period. The results of our study demonstrate that the incidence and mortality of thyroid cancer vary by the geographic location and socio-economic status. Although the incidence was noted to be the highest in very high HDI countries and the Western Pacific region, mortality was noted to be disproportionately higher in the low HDI countries and African region. This may be due to discrepancies in access to care and/or environmental exposures such as ionizing radiation and iodine deficiency. Further measures are required to improve the outcomes from thyroid cancer regardless of the geographic location or socio-economic status.","author":[{"family":"Shank","given":"Jessica B."},{"family":"Are","given":"Chandrakanth"},{"family":"Wenos","given":"Chelsea D."}],"citation-key":"shankThyroidCancerGlobal2022","container-title":"Indian Journal of Surgical Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/s13193-021-01429-y","ISSN":"09766952","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"page":"40-45","publisher":"Springer","title":"Thyroid Cancer: Global Burden and Trends","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"sharifiComparisonParticleSwarm2021","abstract":"Background: Thyroid is a gland that controls body key functions. Since thyroid hormones are responsible for controlling metabolism, the thyroid glands are one of the major organs in the body. Disruption of the glands causes thyroid disease, which is one of the most common endocrine diseases worldwide. Early diagnosis of thyroid disease is difficult since early symptoms are easily confused with those of other illnesses. In recent years, the employment of computer techniques to utilize data mining and intelligent algorithms accelerates the early diagnosis of the disease. Objectives: The current study aimed at evaluating the role of the new automatic method according to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the diagnosis of thyroid disease. Methods: The study aimed at comparing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the genetic algorithms (GA) as training for MLP technique used to diagnose thyroid functional disease. The data were collected for three classes: 150 cases of euthyroidism, 30 cases of hypothyroidism, and 35 cases of hyperthyroidism. MLP was used to elucidate the pattern in the data and species responsible for separating the classes. Furthermore, improved PSO and GAs were used to train the system, and the sensitivity and specificity of the model were studied in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. All analyses were performed using MATLAB software. Results: For the proposed model, the simulations results showed that the GA algorithm had a higher performance than the PSO algorithm in the diagnosis of functional thyroid disease, and the means of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 95%, 96%, and 96%, respectively. Conclusions: The results of real data indicated that the GA-MLP can be used with high diagnostic accuracy as an effective tool to clin-ically diagnose thyroid functional disease. The current study was a step towards prototype system development of the classification of knowledge in this area with a much lower computational cost.","author":[{"family":"Sharifi","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Alizadeh","given":"Kamal"}],"citation-key":"sharifiComparisonParticleSwarm2021","container-title":"Shiraz E Medical Journal","DOI":"10.5812/SEMJ.100351","ISSN":"17351391","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"1-7","publisher":"Kowsar Medical Institute","title":"Comparison of the particle swarm optimization with the genetic algorithms as a training for multilayer perceptron technique to diagnose thyroid functional disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

The present study aims to establish the spatial epidemiology of cancer burden in Africa and delineate the association between cancer burden and the country-level socioeconomic status. The study also examines the forecasts of the cancer burden for 2040 and evaluates infrastructure availability across all African countries. Methods: The estimates of age, sex, and country-specific incidence and mortality of 34 neoplasms in 54 African countries, were procured from GLOBOCAN 2020. Mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) was employed as a proxy indicator of 5-year survival rates, and the socioeconomic development of each country was measured using its human development index (HDI). We regressed age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and MIR on HDI using linear regression model to determine the relationship between cancer burden and HDI. Maps were generated for each cancer group for each country in Africa. The data about the cancer infrastructure of African countries were extracted from the WHO Cancer Country Profiles. Results: In Africa, an estimated 1.1 million new cases [95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) 1.0 – 1.3 million] and 711,429 [611,604 – 827,547] deaths occurred due to neoplasms in 2020. The ASIR was estimated to be 132.1/100,000, varying from 78.4/100,000 (Niger) to 212.5/100,000 (La Réunion) in 2020. The ASMR was 88.8/100,000 in Africa, ranging from 56.6/100,000 in the Republic of the Congo to 139.4/100,000 in Zimbabwe. The MIR of all cancer combined was 0.64 in Africa, varying from 0.49 in Mauritius to 0.78 in The Gambia. HDI had a significant negative correlation with MIR of all cancer groups combined and main cancer groups (prostate, breast, cervical and colorectal). HDI explained 75% of the variation in overall 5-year cancer survival (MIR). By 2040, the burden of all neoplasms combined is forecasted to increase to 2.1 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths in Africa. Conclusion: High cancer mortality rates in Africa demand a holistic approach toward cancer control and management, including, but not limited to, boosting cancer awareness, adopting primary and secondary prevention, mitigating risk factors, improving cancer infrastructure and timely treatment.","author":[{"family":"Sharma","given":"Rajesh"},{"literal":"Aashima"},{"family":"Nanda","given":"Mehak"},{"family":"Fronterre","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Sewagudde","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Ssentongo","given":"Anna E."},{"family":"Yenney","given":"Kelsey"},{"family":"Arhin","given":"Nina D."},{"family":"Oh","given":"John"},{"family":"Amponsah-Manu","given":"Forster"},{"family":"Ssentongo","given":"Paddy"}],"citation-key":"sharmaMappingCancerAfrica2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Public Health","DOI":"10.3389/fpubh.2022.839835","ISSN":"22962565","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"PMID":"35548083","publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Mapping Cancer in Africa: A Comprehensive and Comparable Characterization of 34 Cancer Types Using Estimates From GLOBOCAN 2020","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Several preprocessing techniques are employed to increase the quality of the images, including normalization, Non-Local Means denoising, and alpha-beta enhancement. Effective segmentation is achieved through a combination of Otsu thresholding, morphological operations, distance transformations, and the watershed approach to identify major regions of interest. Through a sequence of blocks, the ECgMLP architecture processes input images to remove unimportant patterns. Model hyperparameters are improved via ablation research. The evaluations show a maximum accuracy of 99.26 % for identifying multi-class histopathological categories of endometrial tissue, which is higher than the previous best technique.

Accurate prognostic estimation for OM has clinical significance. Ascertain the risk factors for survival and develop an effective model to predict the 3-year, 5-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for thyroid cancer patients with OM. Methods: We retrieved the information of patients with OMs between 2010 and 2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program. The Chi-square test, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. Four machine learning (ML) algorithms, which were most commonly used in this field, were applied. Result: A total of 579 patients having OMs were eligible. Advanced age, tumor size ≥ 40 mm, combined with other distant metastasis were associated with worse OS in DTC OMs patients.

  {"id":"shirleyRoleCentralNeck2017","abstract":"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy, and cervical nodal metastases are frequent at presentation. The most common site for nodal metastases from PTC is the central compartment of the ipsilateral neck in the paratracheal and pretracheal regions. The decision to resect these lymph nodes at the time of thyroidectomy often depends on if nodes with suspected malignancy can be identified preoperatively. If nodal spread to the central neck nodes is known, then the consensus is to remove all nodes in this area. However, there remains significant controversy regarding the utility of removing central neck lymph nodes for prophylactic reasons. Herein, we review the potential utility of central neck lymph node dissection as well as the risks of performing this procedure. As well, we review the potential of molecular testing to stratify patients who would most benefit from this procedure. We advocate a selective approach in which patients undergo clinical neck examination coupled with ultrasound to detect any concerning lymph nodes that warrant additional evaluation with either fine needle aspiration or excisional biopsy in the operating room. In lieu of clinical lymphadenopathy, we suggest the use of patient and disease characteristics as identified by multiple groups, such as the American Thyroid Association and European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, which include extremes of ages, large primary tumor size, and male gender, when deciding to perform central neck lymph node dissection.

  {"id":"shiUltrasoundbasedRadiomicsXGBoost2022","abstract":"Objectives: A radiomics-based explainable eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was developed to predict central cervical lymph node metastasis (CCLNM) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), including positive and negative effects. Methods: A total of 587 PTC patients admitted at Binzhou Medical University Hospital from 2017 to 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were randomized into the training and test cohorts with an 8:2 ratio. Radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound images of the primary PTC lesions. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used to select CCLNM positively-related features and radiomics scores were constructed. Clinical features, ultrasound features, and radiomics score were screened out by the Boruta algorithm, and the XGBoost model was constructed from these characteristics. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used for individualized and visualized interpretation. SHAP addressed the cognitive opacity of machine learning models. Results: Eleven radiomics features were used to calculate the radiomics score. Five critical elements were used to build the XGBoost model: capsular invasion, radiomics score, diameter, age, and calcification. The area under the curve was 91.53% and 90.88% in the training and test cohorts, respectively. SHAP plots showed the influence of each parameter on the XGBoost model, including positive (i.e., capsular invasion, radiomics score, diameter, and calcification) and negative (i.e., age) impacts. The XGBoost model outperformed the radiologist, increasing the AUC by 44%. Conclusions: The radiomics-based XGBoost model predicted CCLNM in PTC patients.

  {"id":"shoupPrognosticIndicatorsOutcomes2003","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Distant metastasis is uncommon in differentiated thyroid cancer and the prognosis is unclear. This study aims to evaluate outcomes and to define independent variables that are associated with tumor-related mortality in patients with distant metastasis from thyroid carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the thyroid cancer research database identified 336 patients with distant metastasis from differentiated thyroid carcinoma treated at a single institution between 1941 and 2000. After excluding patients with local or regional recurrence, distant disease was either the first site of recurrence or was detected at the time of diagnosis of the primary tumor in 242 patients (72%). Patient, tumor, and treatment-related factors were analyzed for their relation to disease-specific survival (DSS) using multivariate Cox regression and the log-rank test. RESULTS: Median survival was 4.1 years and 10-year DSS was 26%. Distant disease was synchronous with the primary diagnosis in 97 of 242 (40%) patients. The site of metastasis was lung only in 103 (43%) patients, bone only in 80 (33%), other sites in 14 (6%), and more than one organ system in 45 (19%). Multivariate analysis identified age 45 years or more, symptoms, site other than lung only or bone only, and no radioactive iodine treatment for the metastasis as predictors of poor outcome with 13%, 11%, 16%, and 12% 10-year DSS, respectively. This compares with age less than 45 years, asymptomatic presentation, metastasis only in the lung or bone, and radioactive iodine treatment with 10-year DSS rates of 58%, 45%, 32%, and 33%, respectively (all p < 0.0001). Radioactive iodine treatment was more often given in patients who were less than 45 years of age, asymptomatic, and with metastasis only in the lung or bone only (p = 0.03, 0.11, 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Longterm survival is possible in patients with distant metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancer. This retrospective study found that age of 45 years or more, site other than lung only or bone only, and symptoms at the time of diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes. © 2003 by the American College of Surgeons.","author":[{"family":"Shoup","given":"Margo"},{"family":"Stojadinovic","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Nissan","given":"Aviram"},{"family":"Ghossein","given":"Ronald A."},{"family":"Freedman","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Murray F."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Jatin P."},{"family":"Shaha","given":"Ashok R."}],"citation-key":"shoupPrognosticIndicatorsOutcomes2003","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Surgeons","DOI":"10.1016/S1072-7515(03)00332-6","ISSN":"10727515","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",8,1]]},"page":"191-197","PMID":"12892796","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","title":"Prognostic indicators of outcomes in patients with distant metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"197"},
  {"id":"siegelCancerStatistics20232023","abstract":"Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus‐associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.","author":[{"family":"Siegel","given":"Rebecca L."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Kimberly D."},{"family":"Wagle","given":"Nikita Sandeep"},{"family":"Jemal","given":"Ahmedin"}],"citation-key":"siegelCancerStatistics20232023","container-title":"CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians","DOI":"10.3322/caac.21763","ISSN":"0007-9235","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"page":"17-48","PMID":"36633525","publisher":"Wiley","title":"Cancer statistics, 2023","type":"article-journal","volume":"73"},
  {"id":"slabaughApplicationsMachineDeep2023","abstract":"This review synthesises past research into how machine and deep learning can improve the cyto- and histopathology processing pipelines for thyroid cancer diagnosis. The current gold-standard preoperative technique of fine-needle aspiration cytology has high interobserver variability, often returns indeterminate samples and cannot reliably identify some pathologies; histopathology analysis addresses these issues to an extent, but it requires surgical resection of the suspicious lesions so cannot influence preoperative decisions. Motivated by these issues, as well as by the chronic shortage of trained pathologists, much research has been conducted into how artificial intelligence could improve current pipelines and reduce the pressure on clinicians. Many past studies have indicated the significant potential of automated image analysis in classifying thyroid lesions, particularly for those of papillary thyroid carcinoma, but these have generally been retrospective, so questions remain about both the practical efficacy of these automated tools and the realities of integrating them into clinical workflows. Furthermore, the nature of thyroid lesion classification is significantly more nuanced in practice than many current studies have addressed, and this, along with the heterogeneous nature of processing pipelines in different laboratories, means that no solution has proven itself robust enough for clinical adoption. There are, therefore, multiple avenues for future research: examine the practical implementation of these algorithms as pathologist decision-support systems; improve interpretability, which is necessary for developing trust with clinicians and regulators; and investigate multiclassification on diverse multicentre datasets, aiming for methods that demonstrate high performance in a process- and equipment-agnostic manner.","author":[{"family":"Slabaugh","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Beltran","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Rizvi","given":"Hasan"},{"family":"Deloukas","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Marouli","given":"Eirini"}],"citation-key":"slabaughApplicationsMachineDeep2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2023.958310","ISSN":"2234943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","title":"Applications of machine and deep learning to thyroid cytology and histopathology: a review","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

The normal gland has a characteristic scintigraphic pattern with these tracers and its uptake can be quantified with I-123. Thyroid diseases often produce characteristic abnormal patterns.

We aimed to evaluate the ability of [18F]FDG-PET/CT texture analysis to predict final diagnosis in thyroid incidentaloma. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated medical records of all patients who performed a [18F]FDG-PET/CT from January 2012 to October 2016. Those patients who presented a thyroid incidentaloma described in the medical records and performed a fine needle aspiration in our institution were considered for the analysis. Cytological and/or histological results were used as reference standard to define the final diagnosis. In case of negative cytology, the nodule was considered benign. In case of non-diagnostic or inconclusive results ultrasound, follow-up and further cytology/histology were used as final diagnosis. For suspected or positive cytological result, histology was used as reference standard. PET images were segmented using a General Electric AW workstation running PET VCAR software (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) settled with a threshold of 40% SUVmax. LifeX software (http://www.lifexsoft.org) was used to perform texture analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with R package (https://www.r-project.org). Results: We identified 55 patients with incidental thyroid [18F]FDG uptake. Five patients were excluded from the analysis because a final diagnosis was not available. Thirty-two out of 50 patients had benign nodules while in 18/50 cases a malignancy (primary thyroid cancer = 15, metastases = 3) was diagnosed. Conventional PET parameters and histogram-based features were calculated for all 50 patients, while other matrices-based features were available for 28/50 patients. SUVmax and skewness resulted significantly different in benign and malignant nodules (p = 0.01 and = 0.02, respectively). Using ROC analysis, seven features were identified as potential predictors. Among all the textural features tested, skewness showed the best area under the curve (= 0.66). SUV-based parameters resulted in the highest specificity while MTV, TLG, skewness and kurtosis, as well as correlationGLCM resulted better in sensitivity. Conclusions: [18F]FDG-PET/CT texture analysis seems to be a promising approach to stratify the patients with thyroid incidentaloma identified on PET scans, with respect to the risk of the diagnosis of a malignant thyroid nodule and thus, could refine the selection of the patients to be referred for cytology.","author":[{"family":"Sollini","given":"M."},{"family":"Cozzi","given":"L."},{"family":"Pepe","given":"G."},{"family":"Antunovic","given":"L."},{"family":"Lania","given":"A."},{"family":"Di Tommaso","given":"L."},{"family":"Magnoni","given":"P."},{"family":"Erba","given":"P.

However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.","author":[{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Nitish"},{"family":"Hinton","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Krizhevsky","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Salakhutdinov","given":"Ruslan"}],"citation-key":"srivastavaDropoutSimpleWay2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1929-1958","title":"Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting","type":"report","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"stekhovenMissforestNonparametricMissingValue2012","abstract":"Motivation: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.Results: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

In practice, applying this definition is difficult causing substantial interobserver variability. We aimed to train a deep learning algorithm to detect and quantify the proportion of tall cells (TCs) in PTC. Methods We trained the deep learning algorithm using supervised learning, testing it on an independent dataset, and further validating it on an independent set of 90 PTC samples from patients treated at the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa between 2003 and 2013. We compared the algorithm-based TC percentage to the independent scoring by a human investigator and how those scorings associated with disease outcomes. Additionally, we assessed the TC score in 71 local and distant tumor relapse samples from patients with aggressive disease. Results In the test set, the deep learning algorithm detected TCs with a sensitivity of 93.7% and a specificity of 94.5%, whereas the sensitivity fell to 90.9% and specificity to 94.1% for non- TC areas. In the validation set, the deep learning algorithm TC scores correlated with a diminished relapse-free survival using cutoff points of 10% (p = 0.044), 20% (p < 0.01), and 30% (p = 0.036).

We observed no statistically significant difference in the TC score between primary tumors and relapse tumors determined by the deep learning algorithm or visually.

The data set consisted of 651 pathology-proven thyroid nodules (500 benign, 151 malignant) from 571 patients collected at a single tertiary academic medical center. Each thyroid nodule consisted of two orthogonal views (sagittal and transverse) for a total of 1,302 grayscale images. A CNN classifier was developed to identify malignancy versus benign thyroid nodules, and a nested double cross validation scheme was applied to allow for both model parameter selection and for model accuracy evaluation. All thyroid nodules were classified according to ACR TIRADS criteria and were compared with their respective CNN-generated malignancy scores. The best performing model was the MobileNet CNN ensemble with an area under the curve of 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.90). Thyroid nodules within the highest and lowest CNN risk strata had malignancy rates of 81.4% and 5.9%, respectively. The rate of malignancy for ACR TIRADS ranged from 0% for TR1 nodules to 60% for TR5 nodules. Convolutional neural network malignancy scores correlated well with TIRADS levels, as malignancy scores ranged from 0.194 for TR1 nodules and 0.519 for TR5 nodules. Convolutional neural networks can be trained to generate accurate malignancy risk scores for thyroid nodules. These predictive models can aid in risk stratifying thyroid nodules alongside traditional professional guidelines such as TIRADS and can function as an adjunct tool for the radiologist when identifying those patients requiring further histopathologic workup.","author":[{"family":"Stib","given":"Matthew T."},{"family":"Pan","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Merck","given":"Derek"},{"family":"Middleton","given":"William D."},{"family":"Beland","given":"Michael D."}],"citation-key":"stibThyroidNoduleMalignancy2020","container-title":"Ultrasound Quarterly","DOI":"10.1097/RUQ.0000000000000501","ISSN":"15360253","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"164-172","PMID":"32511208","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Thyroid Nodule Malignancy Risk Stratification Using a Convolutional Neural Network","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"suhPerformanceCTPreoperative2017","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ultrasound has become widely accepted as the first imaging technique used for the assessment of cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluate the performance of CT for the preoperative diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid cancer compared with ultrasound. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ovid-MEDLINE and EMBASE data bases were searched for studies regarding the use of CT to diagnose cervical lymph node metastasis. The diagnostic performance of CT, ultrasound, and combined CT/ultrasound was assessed by using level-by-level and patient-based analyses. We also performed meta-analyses on the basis of the central and lateral neck levels. RESULTS: Nine eligible studies, including a total sample size of 1691 patients, were included. CT showed a summary sensitivity of 62% (95% CI, 52%-70%) and specificity of 87% (95% CI, 80%-92%) for diagnosing cervical lymph node metastasis when using level-by-level analysis. There was a positive correlation between the sensitivity and the false-positive rate (correlation coefficient, 0.807) because of the threshold effect. The summary sensitivity of combined CT/ultrasound (69%; 95% CI, 61%-77%) was significantly higher than ultrasound (51%; 95% CI, 42%-60%), though the summary specificity did not differ.

The pooled results of meta-analysis showed that CT had a higher SEN (0.77 [95% confidence inter­val {CI} 0.73–0.87]) than MRI (0.72 [95% CI 0.70–0.74]) when node was considered as unit of analysis (P0.05); MRI had a higher SPE (0.81 [95% CI 0.80–0.82]) than CT (0.72 [95% CI 0.69–0.74]) when neck level was considered as unit of analysis (P0.05) and MRI had a higher area under concentration-time curve than CT when the patient was considered as unit of analysis (P0.05). With regards to diagnostic criteria, for MRI, the results showed that the minimal axial diameter of 10 mm could be considered as the best size criterion, compared to 12 mm for CT. Overall, MRI conferred significantly higher SPE while CT demonstrated higher SEN.

  {"id":"sunEvaluationDeepLearningbased2020","abstract":"Purpose: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems assist in solving subjective diagnosis problems that typically rely on personal experience. A CAD system has been developed to differentiate malignant thyroid nodules from benign thyroid nodules in ultrasound images based on deep learning methods. The diagnostic performance was compared between the CAD system and the experienced attending radiologists. Methods: The ultrasound image dataset for training the CAD system included 651 malignant nodules and 386 benign nodules while the database for testing included 422 malignant nodules and 128 benign nodules. All the nodules were confirmed by pathology results. In the proposed CAD system, a support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification and fused features which combined the deep features extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the hand-crafted features such as the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), local binary patterns (LBP), and scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) were obtained. The optimal feature subset was formed by selecting these fused features based on the maximum class separation distance and used as the training sample for the SVM. Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the CAD system were 92.5%, 96.4%, and 83.1%, respectively, which were higher than those of the experienced attending radiologists. The areas under the ROC curves of the CAD system and the attending radiologists were 0.881 and 0.819, respectively. Conclusions: The CAD system for thyroid nodules exhibited a better diagnostic performance than experienced attending radiologists. The CAD system could be a reliable supplementary tool to diagnose thyroid nodules using ultrasonography. Macroscopic features in ultrasound images, such as the margins and shape of thyroid nodules, could influence the diagnostic efficiency of the CAD system.","author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yukang"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Tianjiao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shaohang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Qianqian"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Jinpeng"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Weidong"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Lijuan"}],"citation-key":"sunEvaluationDeepLearningbased2020","container-title":"Medical Physics","DOI":"10.1002/mp.14301","ISSN":"24734209","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"page":"3952-3960","PMID":"32473030","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Ltd","title":"Evaluation of a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis system for distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid nodules in ultrasound images","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge","author":[{"family":"Szegedy","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Ioffe","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Vanhoucke","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Alemi","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"szegedyInceptionv4InceptionResNetImpact2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,23]]},"title":"Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261"},

  {"id":"taoAutomaticMetallicSurface2018","abstract":"Automatic metallic surface defect inspection has received increased attention in relation to the quality control of industrial products. Metallic defect detection is usually performed against complex industrial scenarios, presenting an interesting but challenging problem. Traditional methods are based on image processing or shallow machine learning techniques, but these can only detect defects under specific detection conditions, such as obvious defect contours with strong contrast and low noise, at certain scales, or under specific illumination conditions. This paper discusses the automatic detection of metallic defects with a twofold procedure that accurately localizes and classifies defects appearing in input images captured from real industrial environments. A novel cascaded autoencoder (CASAE) architecture is designed for segmenting and localizing defects. The cascading network transforms the input defect image into a pixel-wise prediction mask based on semantic segmentation. The defect regions of segmented results are classified into their specific classes via a compact convolutional neural network (CNN). Metallic defects under various conditions can be successfully detected using an industrial dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that this method meets the robustness and accuracy requirements for metallic defect detection. Meanwhile, it can also be extended to other detection applications.","author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"Xian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dapeng"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Wenzhi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xilong"},{"literal":"De Xu"}],"citation-key":"taoAutomaticMetallicSurface2018","container-title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","DOI":"10.3390/app8091575","ISSN":"20763417","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,6]]},"publisher":"MDPI AG","title":"Automatic metallic surface defect detection and recognition with convolutional neural networks","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"tavaresLymphNodeDistribution2014","abstract":"Background. Dissection of the central compartment of the neck (CCN) is performed for proven or suspected lymph node metastases of thyroid carcinoma. During this procedure, the recurrent laryngeal nerves and the parathyroid glands are at risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the anatomic distribution of the lymph nodes in the CCN. Methods. The anatomic distribution of the lymph nodes in the CCN was studied by dissection of 30 fresh cadavers. The soft tissue between the cricoid cartilage and the innominate vein, carotid arteries, and prevertebral fascia was removed and divided according to CCN sublevels. Nodules were identified by palpation in the specimen and sent for pathological examination. Results. Three to 44 (18.5 ± 10.29) nodules were identified macroscopically. Two to 42 nodules were confirmed as lymph nodes after microscopic examination. The lymph node distribution was as follows: precricoid: 0 to 2 (0.9 ± 0.72); pretracheal: 1 of 35 (12.4 ± 8.19); lateral to the right recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN): 0 to 11 (3.4 ± 2.34); and lateral to the left: 0 to 4 (1.7 ± 1.30). Twenty-six parathyroid glands were removed by 14 dissections. The innominate vein was found at 15 mm above the superior border of the clavicles to 35 mm below on the left side of the neck and 5 to 45 mm on the right side. Conclusion. The number of confirmed lymph nodes in the central neck varied from 2 to 42. Sixty-seven percent of the lymph nodes were in the pretracheal sublevel. There was no division between level VI and VII lymph nodes. Additionally, the innominate vein was found to be from 15 mm above the superior border of the clavicles to 35 mm below on the left side of the neck and 5 to 45 mm on the right side.

  {"id":"teramotoAutomatedClassificationPulmonary2019","abstract":"Objective(s): Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examination is commonly used for the evaluation of pulmonary nodules since it provides both anatomical and functional information. However, given the dependence of this evaluation on physician’s subjective judgment, the results could be variable. The purpose of this study was to develop an automated scheme for the classification of pulmonary nodules using early and delayed phase PET/ CT and conventional CT images. Methods: We analysed 36 early and delayed phase PET/CT images in patients who underwent both PET/CT scan and lung biopsy, following bronchoscopy. In addition, conventional CT images at maximal inspiration were analysed. The images consisted of 18 malignant and 18 benign nodules. For the classification scheme, 25 types of shape and functional features were first calculated from the images. The random forest algorithm, which is a machine learning technique, was used for classification. Results: The evaluation of the characteristic features and classification accuracy was accomplished using collected images. There was a significant difference between the characteristic features of benign and malignant nodules with regard to standardised uptake value and texture. In terms of classification performance, 94.4% of the malignant nodules were identified correctly assuming that 72.2% of the benign nodules were diagnosed accurately. The accuracy rate of benign nodule detection by means of CT plus two-phase PET images was 44.4% and 11.1% higher than those obtained by CT images alone and CT plus early phase PET images, respectively. Conclusion: Based on the findings, the proposed method may be useful to improve the accuracy of malignancy analysis.","author":[{"family":"Teramoto","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Tsujimoto","given":"Masakazu"},{"family":"Inoue","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Tsukamoto","given":"Tetsuya"},{"family":"Imaizumi","given":"Kazuyoshi"},{"family":"Toyama","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Saito","given":"Kuniaki"},{"family":"Fujita","given":"Hiroshi"}],"citation-key":"teramotoAutomatedClassificationPulmonary2019","container-title":"Asia Oceania Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Biology","DOI":"10.22038/AOJNMB.2018.12014","ISSN":"23225726","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"page":"29-37","publisher":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences","title":"Automated classification of pulmonary nodules through a retrospective analysis of conventional ct and two-phase pet images in patients undergoing biopsy","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Most nodules are benign; therefore, many nodules are biopsied to identify the small number that are malignant or require surgery for a definitive diagnosis. Since 2009, many professional societies and investigators have proposed ultrasound-based risk stratification systems to identify nodules that warrant biopsy or sonographic follow-up. Because some of these systems were founded on the BI-RADS® classification that is widely used in breast imaging, their authors chose to apply the acronym TI-RADS, for Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System. In 2012, the ACR convened committees to (1) provide recommendations for reporting incidental thyroid nodules, (2) develop a set of standard terms (lexicon) for ultrasound reporting, and (3) propose a TI-RADS on the basis of the lexicon. The committees published the results of the first two efforts in 2015.

The early clinical diagnosis of breast and thyroid cancers often utilizes ultrasonography. Most of the ultrasound images of breast and thyroid cancer lack specificity, which reduces the accuracy of ultrasound clinical diagnosis. This study attempts to develop an effective convolutional neural network (E-CNN) for the classification of benign and malignant breast and thyroid tumors from ultrasound images. The 2-Dimension (2D) ultrasound images of 1052 breast tumors were collected, and 8245 2D tumor images were obtained from 76 thyroid cases. We performed tenfold cross-validation on breast and thyroid data, with a mean classification accuracy of 0.932 and 0.902, respectively. In addition, the proposed E-CNN was applied to classify and evaluate 9297 mixed images (breast and thyroid images). The mean classification accuracy was 0.875, and the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 0.955. Based on data in the same modality, we transferred the breast model to classify typical tumor images of 76 patients. The finetuning model achieved a mean classification accuracy of 0.945, and a mean AUC of 0.958. Meanwhile, the transfer thyroid model realized a mean classification accuracy of 0.932, and a mean AUC of 0.959, on 1052 breast tumor images. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of the E-CNN to learn the features and classify breast and thyroid tumors.

The aim of this study was to develop an ultrasound (US)-based radiomic nomogram to preoperatively predict the lateral LNM in PTC patients. METHODS In this retrospective study, a total of 886 patients were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups. Radiomic features were extracted from the preoperative US images. A radiomic signature was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm in the training set. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to develop the radiomic nomogram, which incorporating the radiomic signature and the selected clinical characteristics. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness in both the training and validation sets. RESULTS The radiomic signature was significantly associated with the lateral LNM in both cohorts (p< 0.001). The nomogram that consisted of radiomic signature, US-reported cervical lymph node (CLN) status, and CT-reported CLN status demonstrated good discrimination and calibration in the training and validation sets with an AUC of 0.946 and 0.914, respectively. The decision curve analysis indicated that the radiomic nomogram was worthy of clinical application.

  {"id":"toraihSitespecificMetastasisSurvival2021","abstract":"Introduction—heterogeneity in clinical outcomes and survival was observed in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and distant metastases. Here, we investigated the effect of distant metastases sites on survival in PTC patients. Methods—patients with a diagnosis of PTC and known metastases were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1975–2016). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to analyze the effect of distant metastases sites on thyroid cancer-specific survival (TCSS) and overall survival (OS). Results—from 89,694 PTC patients, 1819 (2%) developed distant metastasis at the initial diagnosis, of whom 26.3% presented with the multiple-organ disease. The most common metastatic sites were lung (53.4%), followed by bone (28.1%), liver (8.3%), and brain (4.7%). In metastatic patients, thyroid cancer-specific death accounted for 73.2%. Kaplan–Meier curves showed decreased OS in patients with metastases to the brain (median OS = 5 months) and liver (median OS = 6 months) compared to lung (median OS = 10 months) and bone (median OS = 23 months). Moreover, multiple organ metastasis had a higher mortality rate (67.4%) compared to single organ metastasis (51.2%, p < 0.001). Using multivariate analysis, risk factors that significantly influence TCSS and OS were male gender (HR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.17–2.94, p < 0.001, and HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.40–2.57, p = 0.009), higher tumor grade (HR = 7.31, 95% CI = 2.13–25.0, p < 0.001 and HR = 4.76, 95% CI = 3.93–5.76, p < 0.001), multiple organ involvement (HR = 6.52, 95% CI = 1.50–28.39, p = 0.026 and HR = 5.08, 95% CI = 1.21–21.30, p = 0.013), and brain metastasis (HR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.15–2.89, p < 0.001 and HR = 4.21, 95% CI = 2.20–8.07, p = 0.010).

We have previously demonstrated the potential of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting cancer driver gene mutations from expert-curated histopathologic images in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Recognizing the importance of whole slide image (WSI) analysis for clinical application, we aimed to develop an automated image preprocessing workflow that uses WSI inputs to categorize PTCs based on driver mutations. Methods: Histopathology slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository were utilized for diagnostic purposes. These slides underwent an automated tile extraction and preprocessing pipeline to ensure analysis-ready quality. Next, the extracted image tiles were utilized to train a deep learning CNN model, specifically Google’s Inception v3, for the classification of PTCs. The model was trained to distinguish between different groups based on BRAFV600E or RAS mutations. Results: The newly developed pipeline performed equally well as the expert-curated image classifier. The best model achieved Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.86 (ranging from 0.847 to 0.872) for validation and 0.865 (ranging from 0.854 to 0.876) for the final testing subsets. Notably, it accurately predicted 90% of tumors in the validation set and 84.2% in the final testing set. Furthermore, the performance of our new classifier showed a strong correlation with the expert-curated classifier (Spearman rho = 0.726, p = 5.28 e-08), and correlated with the molecular expression-based classifier, BRS (BRAF-RAS scores) (Spearman rho = 0.418, p = 1.92e-13).

Methods: A writing group was convened by the Surgical Affairs Committee of the American Thyroid Association and was tasked with identifying the important clinical elements to consider when managing recurrent/persistent nodal disease in patients with DTC based on the available evidence in the literature and the group's collective experience. The decision on how best to manage individual patients with suspected recurrent/persistent nodal disease is challenging and requires the consideration of a significant number of variables outlined by the members of the interdisciplinary team. Here we report on the consensus opinions that were reached by the writing group regarding the technical and clinical issues encountered in this patient population. Conclusions: Identification of recurrent/persistent disease requires a team decision-making process that includes the patient and physicians as to what, if any, intervention should be performed to best control the disease while minimizing morbidity.

We present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep learning method for long-term pan-cancer survival prediction. MultiSurv uses dedicated submodels to establish feature representations of clinical, imaging, and different high-dimensional omics data modalities. A data fusion layer aggregates the multimodal representations, and a prediction submodel generates conditional survival probabilities for follow-up time intervals spanning several decades. MultiSurv is the first non-linear and non-proportional survival prediction method that leverages multimodal data. In addition, MultiSurv can handle missing data, including single values and complete data modalities. MultiSurv was applied to data from 33 different cancer types and yields accurate pan-cancer patient survival curves. A quantitative comparison with previous methods showed that Multisurv achieves the best results according to different time-dependent metrics. We also generated visualizations of the learned multimodal representation of MultiSurv, which revealed insights on cancer characteristics and heterogeneity.","author":[{"family":"Vale-Silva","given":"Luís A."},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"vale-silvaLongtermCancerSurvival2021","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-92799-4","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"PMID":"34188098","publisher":"Nature Research","title":"Long-term cancer survival prediction using multimodal deep learning","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

However, studies evaluating the detection of distant metastases and how these guidelines perform in patients with distant metastases are scarce. Objective: To evaluate the 2015 ATA Guidelines in DTC patients with respect to 1) the detection of distant metastases, and 2) the accuracy of its Risk Stratification System in patients with distant metastases. Patients and Main Outcome Measures: We retrospectively included 83 DTC patients who were diagnosed with distant metastases around the time of initial therapy, and a control population of 472 patients (312 low-risk, 160 intermediate-risk) who did not have a routine indication for RAI therapy. We used the control group to assess the percentage of distant metastases that would have been missed if no RAI therapy was given. Results: Two hundred forty-six patients had no routine indication for RAI therapy of which 4 (1.6%) had distant metastases. Furthermore, among the 83 patients with distant metastases, 14 patients (17%) had excellent response, while 55 (67%) had structural disease after a median follow-up of 62 months. None of the 14 patients that achieved an excellent response had a recurrence. Conclusions: In patients without a routine indication for RAI therapy according to the 2015 ATA Guidelines, distant metastases would initially have been missed in 1.6% of the patients. Furthermore, in patients with distant metastases upon diagnosis, the 2015 ATA Guidelines are an excellent predictor of both persistent disease and recurrence.","author":[{"family":"Van Velsen","given":"Evert F.S."},{"family":"Stegenga","given":"Merel T."},{"family":"Van Kemenade","given":"Folkert J."},{"family":"Kam","given":"Boen L.R."},{"family":"Van Ginhoven","given":"Tessa M."},{"family":"Visser","given":"W.

Therefore, this study aims to develop and test an efficient and accurate deep learning scheme that assists radiologists in automatically recognizing and localizing COVID-19. A retrospective chest X-ray image dataset was collected from open image data and the Xiangya Hospital, which was divided into a training group and a testing group. The proposed CAD framework is composed of two steps with DLs: the Discrimination-DL and the Localization-DL. The first DL was developed to extract lung features from chest X-ray radiographs for COVID-19 discrimination and trained using 3548 chest X-ray radiographs. The second DL was trained with 406-pixel patches and applied to the recognized X-ray radiographs to localize and assign them into the left lung, right lung or bipulmonary. X-ray radiographs of CAP and healthy controls were enrolled to evaluate the robustness of the model. Compared to the radiologists’ discrimination and localization results, the accuracy of COVID-19 discrimination using the Discrimination-DL yielded 98.71%, while the accuracy of localization using the Localization-DL was 93.03%.

  {"id":"wangCanCervicalLymph2022","abstract":"Background: Distant metastasis (DM) is a rare event and has a negative effect on the prognosis for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The relationship between cervical lymph node metastasis and DM is complicated and unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of N stage subclassification on different distant metastasis sites based on age stratification, especially for patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. Methods: A total of 28,712 patient with PTC cases between 2010 and 2018 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to adjust for confounding variables. Risk stratification, including positive lymph node number and lymph node ratio, was established by receiver operating characteristic curves to help predict DM. Results: Lung was the most common metastatic site regardless of N0, N1a disease, or N1b disease. As the N stage increased, the higher the rate of DM identified. After age stratification, only N1b disease significantly increased the risk of lung metastasis (LM; odds ratio, OR = 20.45, P < 0.001) rather than bone metastasis (BM; OR = 3.46, P > 0.05) in younger patients. However, in older patients, N1b disease significantly increased the risk of both LM (OR = 4.10, P < 0.001) and BM (OR = 2.65, P = 0.007). In patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), N1a disease did not increase the risk of DM, LM, and BM compared with N0 disease (P > 0.05). Furthermore, combined N stage with risk stratification has well performance in predicting DM (area under the curve, AUC = 0.761). Similar results were shown in PTC patients with LM (AUC = 0.770) and BM (AUC = 0.729). Conclusion: Overall, the incidence of DM significantly increased with the progress of N disease after age stratification. N1a disease did not increase the risk of DM in PTMC patients, regardless of LM or BM. Combined N stage with risk stratification may be beneficial for DM prediction.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenlong"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xinying"}],"citation-key":"wangCanCervicalLymph2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2022.917794","ISSN":"16642392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,24]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Can Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis Increase the Risk of Distant Metastasis in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma?","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Many non-invasive methods have been developed with the help of the Internet of Things to improve the detection rate of malignant nodules.

In general, convolutional neural networks based deep learning methods have achieved promising performance in many medical image analysis and classification applications; however, no existing comparison has been done between radiomics based and deep learning based approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to compare the performance of radiomics and deep learning based methods for the classification of thyroid nodules from ultrasound images. On one hand, we developed a radiomics based method, which consists of extracting high throughput 302-dimensional statistical features from pre-processed images. Then dimension reduction was performed using mutual information and linear discriminant analysis respectively to achieve the final classification. On the other hand, a deep learning based method was also developed and tested by pre-training a VGG16 model with fine-tuning. Ultrasound images including 3120 images (1841 benign nodules and 1393 malignant nodules) from 1040 cases were retrospectively collected. The dataset was divided into 80% training and 20% testing data. The highest accuracies yielded on the testing data for radiomics and deep learning based methods were 66.81% and 74.69%, respectively.

A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"wangCOVIDNetTailoredDeep2020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,22]]},"title":"COVID-Net: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-Ray Images","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09871"},

Results: Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, maximum diameter of thyroid nodules, capsular invasion, and BRAF V600E gene mutation were independent risk factors for CLNM, and statistically significant indicators were included to construct a nomogram prediction model, which had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.778. A convolutional neural network (CNN) prediction model built with an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning algorithm achieved AUCs of 0.89 in the training set and 0.78 in the test set, which indicated a high prediction efficacy for CLNM. In addition, the prediction models were validated in the subclinical metastasis and clinical metastasis groups with high sensitivity and specificity, suggesting the broad applicability of the models.

  {"id":"wangDeepLearningModels2024","abstract":"Background: Accurately distinguishing between malignant and benign thyroid nodules through fine-needle aspiration cytopathology is crucial for appropriate therapeutic intervention. However, cytopathologic diagnosis is time consuming and hindered by the shortage of experienced cytopathologists. Reliable assistive tools could improve cytopathologic diagnosis efficiency and accuracy. We aimed to develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI)-assistive system for thyroid cytopathologic diagnosis according to the Thyroid Bethesda Reporting System. Methods: 11 254 whole-slide images (WSIs) from 4037 patients were used to train deep learning models. Among the selected WSIs, cell level was manually annotated by cytopathologists according to The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) guidelines of the second edition (2017 version). A retrospective dataset of 5638 WSIs of 2914 patients from four medical centres was used for validation. 469 patients were recruited for the prospective study of the performance of AI models and their 537 thyroid nodule samples were used. Cohorts for training and validation were enrolled between Jan 1, 2016, and Aug 1, 2022, and the prospective dataset was recruited between Aug 1, 2022, and Jan 1, 2023. The performance of our AI models was estimated as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The primary outcomes were the prediction sensitivity and specificity of the model to assist cyto-diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Findings: The AUROC of TBSRTC III+ (which distinguishes benign from TBSRTC classes III, IV, V, and VI) was 0·930 (95% CI 0·921–0·939) for Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (SYSMH) internal validation and 0·944 (0·929 – 0·959), 0·939 (0·924–0·955), 0·971 (0·938–1·000) for The First People's Hospital of Foshan (FPHF), Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute (SCHI), and The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (TAHGMU) medical centres, respectively. The AUROC of TBSRTC V+ (which distinguishes benign from TBSRTC classes V and VI) was 0·990 (95% CI 0·986–0·995) for SYSMH internal validation and 0·988 (0·980–0·995), 0·965 (0·953–0·977), and 0·991 (0·972–1·000) for FPHF, SCHI, and TAHGMU medical centres, respectively. For the prospective study at SYSMH, the AUROC of TBSRTC III+ and TBSRTC V+ was 0·977 and 0·981, respectively. With the assistance of AI, the specificity of junior cytopathologists was boosted from 0·887 (95% CI 0·8440–0·922) to 0·993 (0·974–0·999) and the accuracy was improved from 0·877 (0·846–0·904) to 0·948 (0·926–0·965). 186 atypia of undetermined significance samples from 186 patients with BRAF mutation information were collected; 43 of them harbour the BRAFV600E mutation. 91% (39/43) of BRAFV600E-positive atypia of undetermined significance samples were identified as malignant by the AI models.

  {"id":"wangDiagnosisCervicalLymph2023","abstract":"Introduction: The incidence of thyroid diseases has increased in recent years, and cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) is considered an important risk factor for locoregional recurrence. This study aims to develop a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method to diagnose cervical LNM with thyroid carcinoma on computed tomography (CT) images. Methods: A new deep learning framework guided by the analysis of CT data for automated detection and classification of LNs on CT images is proposed. The presented CAD system consists of two stages. First, an improved region-based detection network is designed to learn pyramidal features for detecting small nodes at different feature scales. The region proposals are constrained by the prior knowledge of the size and shape distributions of real nodes. Then, a residual network with an attention module is proposed to perform the classification of LNs. The attention module helps to classify LNs in the fine-grained domain, improving the whole classification network performance. Results: A total of 574 axial CT images (including 676 lymph nodes: 103 benign and 573 malignant lymph nodes) were retrieved from 196 patients who underwent CT for surgical planning. For detection, the data set was randomly subdivided into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%), where each CT image was expanded to 20 images by rotation, mirror image, changing brightness, and Gaussian noise. The extended data set included 11,480 CT images. The proposed detection method outperformed three other detection architectures (average precision of 80.3%). For classification, ROI of lymph node metastasis labeled by radiologists were used to train the classification network. The 676 lymph nodes were randomly divided into 70% of the training set (73 benign and 401 malignant lymph nodes) and 30% of the test set (30 benign and 172 malignant lymph nodes). The classification method showed superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 96%, true positive and negative rates of 98.8 and 80%, respectively. It outperformed radiologists with an area under the curve of 0.894. Discussion: The extensive experiments verify the high efficiency of the proposed method. It is considered instrumental in a clinical setting to diagnose cervical LNM with thyroid carcinoma using preoperative CT images. The future research can consider adding radiologists' experience and domain knowledge into the deep-learning based CAD method to make it more clinically significant.

The studies were screened according to inclusion and exclusion requirements, and the methodologic quality of the included studies was independently assessed by 2 reviewers using tailored questionnaires and criteria provided by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of cervical LNM for the central region, lateral neck, and whole neck. Meta-regression was performed to determine which parameters caused high diagnostic heterogeneity. Results: We included 11 studies of 6,261 patients with TC and 8,394 non-TC patients were included in the study. Most of the risk assessments included in the study were low risk, with no high-risk items. For the parallel test of US + CT, pooled sensitivity and specificity in the central region and lateral neck were 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.85] and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72-0.85), respectively. The calculated positive likelihood ratio was 3.6 (95% CI: 2.9-4.4), negative likelihood ratio was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20-0.56), and DOR was 11 (95% CI: 6-18). The area under the curve was 0.83. For US + CT, the pooled sensitivity and specificity in the central region and lateral neck were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56-0.85) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72-0.85), respectively. Discussion: The diagnostic efficiency of CT for lateral cervical LNM is greater than for central cervical LNM. CT has high sensitivity and accuracy for the diagnosis of central cervical LNMs. US + CT is important for the preoperative examination of cervical LNMs in TC.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Menghan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Peijun"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Jiahui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Gaoyi"}],"citation-key":"wangDiagnosticPerformanceUltrasound2022","container-title":"Gland Surgery","DOI":"10.21037/gs-22-347","ISSN":"2227684X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,1]]},"page":"1212-1223","publisher":"AME Publishing Company","title":"Diagnostic performance of ultrasound and computed tomography in parallel for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in patients with thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://gs.amegroups.com/article/view/98580/html","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"wangESRGANEnhancedSuperResolution2018","abstract":"The Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) is a seminal work that is capable of generating realistic textures during single image super-resolution. However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN - network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge.

  {"id":"wangGeographicDisparitiesTrends2023","abstract":"Background The rising incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has generated growing concern globally; yet there are no studies examining whether this incidence was followed by a rise in related mortality. We aimed to comprehensively quantify current trends and future projections of TC incidence and mortality, and to explore the association between the TC burden and socioeconomic inequality in different income strata. Methods We obtained incidence and mortality data on TC and population from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and the United Nations’ World Population Prospects 2022. We applied an age-period-cohort (APC) model to estimate the overall annual percentage change (net drift) and age, period, and cohort effects from 1990 to 2019, and also constructed a Bayesian APC model to predict the TC burden through 2030. Results Over a third of global TC cases belonged to the high-income group. From 1990 to 2019, net drifts of TC incidence were?>0 in all income groups, while a modest reduction (net drift <0) in mortality was observed in most income groups, except for the lower-middle-income group. Unfavourable age, period, and cohort effects were most notable in Vietnam, China, and Korea. The age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) is predicted to increase whereas the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) is expected to decrease globally between 2020 and 2030, with geographic heterogeneity being detected across income groups. We observed a positive correlation between ASIR and universal health coverage index and health worker density, but a negative one between ASMR and the two indicators, primarily in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. Conclusions Opposite patterns in incidence and mortality of TC raise concerns about overdiagnosis, particularly in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. Discrepancies in the distribution of health service accessibility, including diagnostic techniques and therapeutic care, should be addressed by narrowing health inequalities in the TC burden across countries.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Chenran"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Xuesi"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Zilin"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Yadi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yongjie"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Jufang"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Jiansong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jibin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yawei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Wanqing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ni"}],"citation-key":"wangGeographicDisparitiesTrends2023","container-title":"Journal of Global Health","DOI":"10.7189/JOGH.13.04108","ISSN":"20472986","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"PMID":"37766638","publisher":"University of Edinburgh","title":"Geographic disparities in trends of thyroid cancer incidence and mortality from 1990 to 2019 and a projection to 2030 across income-classified countries and territories","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"wangSoftLabelDeep2022","abstract":"According to the World Health Organization Report 2022, cancer is the most common cause of death contributing to nearly one out of six deaths worldwide. Early cancer diagnosis and prognosis have become essential in reducing the mortality rate. On the other hand, cancer detection is a challenging task in cancer pathology. Trained pathologists can detect cancer, but their decisions are subjective to high intra- and inter-observer variability, which can lead to poor patient care owing to false-positive and false-negative results. In this study, we present a soft label fully convolutional network (SL-FCN) to assist in breast cancer target therapy and thyroid cancer diagnosis, using four datasets. To aid in breast cancer target therapy, the proposed method automatically segments human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and dual in situ hybridization (DISH) images. To help in thyroid cancer diagnosis, the proposed method automatically segments papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) on Papanicolaou-stained fine needle aspiration and thin prep whole slide images (WSIs). In the evaluation of segmentation of HER2 amplification in FISH and DISH images, we compare the proposed method with thirteen deep learning approaches, including U-Net, U-Net with InceptionV5, Ensemble of U-Net with Inception-v4, Inception-Resnet-v2 encoder, and ResNet-34 encoder, SegNet, FCN, modified FCN, YOLOv5, CPN, SOLOv2, BCNet, and DeepLabv3+ with three different backbones, including MobileNet, ResNet, and Xception, on three clinical datasets, including two DISH datasets on two different magnification levels and a FISH dataset. The result on DISH breast dataset 1 shows that the proposed method achieves high accuracy of 87.77 ± 14.97%, recall of 91.20 ± 7.72%, and F1-score of 81.67 ± 17.76%, while, on DISH breast dataset 2, the proposed method achieves high accuracy of 94.64 ± 2.23%, recall of 83.78 ± 6.42%, and F1-score of 85.14 ± 6.61% and, on the FISH breast dataset, the proposed method achieves high accuracy of 93.54 ± 5.24%, recall of 83.52 ± 13.15%, and F1-score of 86.98 ± 9.85%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms most of the benchmark approaches by a significant margin (p  (Formula presented.)). In evaluation of segmentation of PTC on Papanicolaou-stained WSIs, the proposed method is compared with three deep learning methods, including Modified FCN, U-Net, and SegNet. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed method achieves high accuracy of 99.99 ± 0.01%, precision of 92.02 ± 16.6%, recall of 90.90 ± 14.25%, and F1-score of 89.82 ± 14.92% and significantly outperforms the baseline methods, including U-Net and FCN (p  (Formula presented.)). With the high degree of accuracy, precision, and recall, the results show that the proposed method could be used in assisting breast cancer target therapy and thyroid cancer diagnosis with faster evaluation and minimizing human judgment errors.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ching Wei"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Kuan Yu"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Yi Jia"},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Muhammad Adil"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Kai Lin"},{"family":"Chao","given":"Tai Kuang"}],"citation-key":"wangSoftLabelDeep2022","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers14215312","ISSN":"20726694","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,1]]},"publisher":"MDPI","title":"A Soft Label Deep Learning to Assist Breast Cancer Target Therapy and Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"wildman-tobrinerUsingArtificialIntelligence2019","abstract":"Background: Risk stratification systems for thyroid nodules are often complicated and affected by low specificity. Continual improvement of these systems is necessary to reduce the number of unnecessary thyroid biopsies. Purpose: To use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS). Materials and Methods: A total of 1425 biopsy-proven thyroid nodules from 1264 consecutive patients (1026 women; mean age, 52.9 years [range, 18-93 years]) were evaluated retrospectively. Expert readers assigned points based on five ACR TI-RADS categories (composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci), and a genetic AI algorithm was applied to a training set (1325 nodules). Point and pathologic data were used to create an optimized scoring system (hereafter, AI TI-RADS). Performance of the systems was compared by using a test set of the final 100 nodules with interpretations from the expert reader, eight nonexpert readers, and an expert panel. Initial performance of AI TI-RADS was calculated by using a test for differences between binomial proportions. Additional comparisons across readers were conducted by using bootstrapping; diagnostic performance was assessed by using area under the receiver operating curve. Results: AI TI-RADS assigned new point values for eight ACR TI-RADS features. Six features were assigned zero points, which simplified categorization. By using expert reader data, the diagnostic performance of ACR TI-RADS and AI TI-RADS was area under the receiver operating curve of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. For the same expert, specificity of AI TI-RADS (65%, 55 of 85) was higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (47%, 40 of 85). For the eight nonexpert radiologists, mean specificity for AI TIRADS (55%) was also higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (48%). An interactive AI TI-RADS calculator can be viewed at http://deckard.duhs.duke.edu/~ai-ti-rads. Conclusion: An artificial intelligence-optimized Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) validates the American College of Radiology TI-RADS while slightly improving specificity and maintaining sensitivity. Additionally, it simplifies feature assignments, which may improve ease of use.","author":[{"family":"Wildman-Tobriner","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Buda","given":"Mateusz"},{"family":"Hoang","given":"Jenny K."},{"family":"Middleton","given":"William D."},{"family":"Thayer","given":"David"},{"family":"Short","given":"Ryan G."},{"family":"Tessler","given":"Franklin N."},{"family":"Mazurowski","given":"Maciej A."}],"citation-key":"wildman-tobrinerUsingArtificialIntelligence2019","container-title":"Radiology","DOI":"10.1148/radiol.2019182128","ISSN":"15271315","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"112-119","PMID":"31112088","publisher":"Radiological Society of North America Inc.","title":"Using artificial intelligence to revise ACR TI-RADS risk stratification of thyroid nodules: Diagnostic accuracy and utility","type":"article-journal","volume":"292"},
  {"id":"wirthIncidenceMortalityTrends2021","abstract":"AIMS OF THE STUDY: Thyroid cancer incidence rates have been increasing globally over past decades. However, no study examining those trends in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland exists. In this study, we describe the incidence and mortality trends of thyroid cancer in the canton of Zurich during a 37-year period (1980–2016) including factors such as sex, histological subtypes and age at diagnosis. METHODS: We analysed population-based cancer registry data from 1980-2016 for the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. We estimated the age-standardised incidence and mortality rates using the European standard population. Joinpoint regression was used to detect average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We included 2972 primary cases of thyroid cancer (72.3% in women). The papillary cases accounted for the majority of incident cases (65.8%). In 2016, women had a higher age-standardised incidence rate than men for both papillary (10.4 and 3.3, respectively, per 100,000) and non-papillary (1.6 and 0.7, respectively, per 100,000) thyroid cancer. In both men and women, the incidence rates of thyroid cancer increased significantly over the study period with AAPCs of 1.4% (95% CI 0.6–2.2%) and 2.6% (95% CI 2–3.1%), respectively. These increasing incidence trends are mainly driven by papillary thyroid cancer with AAPCs of 3.4% in men (95% CI 2.3% to 4.4%) and 4.3% in women (95% CI 3.7% to 5%). Mortality rates significantly decreased in both sexes (men AAPC –3.6%, 95% CI –4.7% to –2.4%; women AAPC –3.7%, 95% CI –4.8% to –2.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show significantly increasing age-standardised incidence rates of thyroid cancer over time in both sexes, mainly due to papillary thyroid cancer, the most frequent histological subtype, and the only subtype for which a significant increase was observed. It is possible that many indolent thyroid cancers, and more specifically papillary microcarcinomas, are increasingly diagnosed, which may not lead to symptoms if undetected. Therefore, targeted diagnostic strategies are necessary to avoid overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer. Nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude a partly true increase.","author":[{"family":"Wirth","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Syleouni","given":"Maria Eleni"},{"family":"Karavasiloglou","given":"Nena"},{"family":"Rinaldi","given":"Sabina"},{"family":"Korol","given":"Dimitri"},{"family":"Wanner","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Rohrmann","given":"Sabine"}],"citation-key":"wirthIncidenceMortalityTrends2021","container-title":"Swiss Medical Weekly","DOI":"10.4414/smw.2021.w30029","ISSN":"14243997","issue":"43-44","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"PMID":"34751539","publisher":"EMH Schweizerischer Arzteverlag AG","title":"Incidence and mortality trends of thyroid cancer from 1980 to 2016","type":"article-journal","volume":"151"},

BRAFV600E is a prominent oncogenic mutation and has been found to have strong associations with the mortality and recurrence of PTC. In this paper, we propose a workflow to show that BRAFV600E mutation status can be directly predicted from histopathological images with deep learning. Our method mainly consists of two steps, tumor detection and mutation classification; each of them contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The information derived from the two steps are combined to predict mutation. We propose three different strategies and build a PTC dataset of 6,541,586 512×512-pixel patches from 439 H&E stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to perform our experiments. In the PTC-V600E strategy, we use patches from 50 PTC WSIs and 202 WSIs of 200 cases to train the two networks, respectively, and get an AUC of 0.884 on the test of 187 WSIs of 186 cases. In PCam-V600E and PAIP-V600E strategies, we use public datasets, PCam and PAIP 2019, of other cancer types instead of 50 PTC WSIs and get AUCs of 0.884 and 0.860.

Approximately 4%–8% of TAO patients will deteriorate and develop the most severe dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON). According to the current data provided by clinical experts, there is still a certain proportion of suspected DON patients who cannot be diagnosed, and the clinical evaluation has low sensitivity and specificity. There is an urgent need for an efficient and accurate method to assist physicians in identifying DON. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning model to accurately identify suspected DON patients using computed tomography (CT). The hybrid model is mainly composed of the double multiscale and multi attention fusion module (DMs-MAFM) and a deep convolutional neural network. The DMs-MAFM is the feature extraction module proposed in this study, and it contains a multiscale feature fusion algorithm and improved channel attention and spatial attention, which can capture the features of tiny objects in the images. Multiscale feature fusion is combined with an attention mechanism to form a multilevel feature extraction module. The multiscale fusion algorithm can aggregate different receptive field features, and then fully obtain the channel and spatial correlation of the feature map through the multiscale channel attention aggregation module and spatial attention module, respectively. According to the experimental results, the hybrid model proposed in this study can accurately identify suspected DON patients, with Accuracy reaching 96%, Specificity reaching 99.5%, Sensitivity reaching 94%, Precision reaching 98.9% and F1-score reaching 96.4%.

  {"id":"wulczynDeepLearningbasedSurvival2020","abstract":"Providing prognostic information at the time of cancer diagnosis has important implications for treatment and monitoring. Although cancer staging, histopathological assessment, molecular features, and clinical variables can provide useful prognostic insights, improving risk stratification remains an active research area. We developed a deep learning system (DLS) to predict disease specific survival across 10 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used a weakly-supervised approach without pixel-level annotations, and tested three different survival loss functions. The DLS was developed using 9,086 slides from 3,664 cases and evaluated using 3,009 slides from 1,216 cases. In multivariable Cox regression analysis of the combined cohort including all 10 cancers, the DLS was significantly associated with disease specific survival (hazard ratio of 1.58, 95% CI 1.28–1.70, p<0.0001) after adjusting for cancer type, stage, age, and sex. In a per-cancer adjusted subanalysis, the DLS remained a significant predictor of survival in 5 of 10 cancer types. Compared to a baseline model including stage, age, and sex, the c-index of the model demonstrated an absolute 3.7% improvement (95% CI 1.0–6.5) in the combined cohort. Additionally, our models stratified patients within individual cancer stages, particularly stage II (p = 0.025) and stage III (p<0.001). By developing and evaluating prognostic models across multiple cancer types, this work represents one of the most comprehensive studies exploring the direct prediction of clinical outcomes using deep learning and histopathology images. Our analysis demonstrates the potential for this approach to provide significant prognostic information in multiple cancer types, and even within specific pathologic stages. However, given the relatively small number of cases and observed clinical events for a deep learning task of this type, we observed wide confidence intervals for model performance, thus highlighting that future work will benefit from larger datasets assembled for the purposes for survival modeling.","author":[{"family":"Wulczyn","given":"Ellery"},{"family":"Steiner","given":"David F."},{"family":"Xu","given":"Zhaoyang"},{"family":"Sadhwani","given":"Apaar"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hongwu"},{"family":"Flament-Auvigne","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Mermel","given":"Craig H."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Po Hsuan Cameron"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Stumpe","given":"Martin C."}],"citation-key":"wulczynDeepLearningbasedSurvival2020","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0233678","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"PMID":"32555646","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Deep learning-based survival prediction for multiple cancer types using histopathology images","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"wuMachineLearningAlgorithms2020","abstract":"Background: Central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) occurs frequently in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), but performing prophylactic central lymph node dissection is still controversial. There are no reliable models for predicting CLNM. This study aimed to develop predictive models for CLNM by machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: Patients with PTC who underwent initial thyroid resection at our hospital between January 2018 and December 2019 were enrolled. A total of 22 variables, including clinical characteristics and ultrasonography (US) features, were used for conventional univariate and multivariate analysis and to construct ML-based models. A 5-fold cross validation strategy was used for validation and a feature selection approach was applied to identify risk factors. Results: The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 7 models ranged from 0.680 to 0.731. All models performed significantly better than US (AUC=0.623) in predicting CLNM (P<0.05). In decision curve, most of the models also performed better than US. The gradient boosting decision tree model with 7 variables was identified as the best model because of its best performance in both ROC (AUC=0.731) and decision curves. Based on multivariate analysis and feature selection, young age, male sex, low serum thyroid peroxidase antibody and US features such as suspected lymph nodes, microcalcification and tumor size > 1.1 cm were the most contributing predictors for CLNM. Conclusions: It is feasible to develop predictive models of CLNM in PTC patients by incorporating clinical characteristics and US features.

  {"id":"xiAIBRAFV600EDeepConvolutional2023","abstract":"Background: The BRAFV600E mutation is a valuable indicator for thyroid cancer diagnosis. This study aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model based on ultrasound images to predict the BRAFV600E mutation status of thyroid nodules. Methods: The ultrasound images were obtained from four hospitals between January 2017 and January 2022. We trained and validated the DCNN model based on the primary set from center 1 (979 images, 528 patients). The DCNN network consists of Conv block, Downsample block, Gaussian error linear unit, Global Average Polling, and Full Connected. The predictive performance of this model was evaluated by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in four independent test sets from center 1 to center 4 (531 images, 282 patients). Heatmaps were used to visualize the most predictive regions of each image. Specimens obtained through fine-needle aspiration or surgery were used to detect the BRAFV600E mutation. Results: The DCNN model achieved encouraging predictive performance by fivefold cross-validation (AUC 0.95) in the primary set. This performance was further confirmed in the independent internal test set (AUC 0.93) and three independent external test sets (AUC 0.84–0.88).

Accurate staging, treatment planning and prognostication in EC patients are of vital importance. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques demonstrate their potential to provide novel quantitative imaging markers in medical imaging. Radiomics approaches that could quantify medical images into high-dimensional data have been shown to improve the imaging-based classification system in characterizing the heterogeneity of primary tumors and lymph nodes in EC patients. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence of the most recent developments in ML application in imaging pertinent to EC patient care.

  {"id":"xieUltrasonographyThyroidNodules2016","abstract":"Thyroid nodules are a common occurrence in the general population, and these incidental thyroid nodules are often referred for ultrasound (US) evaluation. US provides a safe and fast method of examination. It is sensitive for the detection of thyroid nodules, and suspicious features can be used to guide further investigation/management decisions. However, given the financial burden on the health service and unnecessary anxiety for patients, it is unrealistic to biopsy every thyroid nodule to confirm diagnosis. The British Thyroid Association (BTA) has recently produced a US classification (U1–U5) of thyroid nodules to facilitate the decision-making process regarding the need to perform fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for suspicious cases. In this pictorial review, we provide a complete series of sonographic images to illustrate benign and malignant features of thyroid nodules according to the U1–5 classification. Specifically, we highlight morphologic characteristic of the nodule, including its echo signal in relation to its consistency, nodular size, number and contour. Additional diagnostic features such as halo, colloid, calcification and vascular patterns are also discussed in detail. The aim is to assist radiologists and clinicians in recognising sonographic patterns of benign, suspicious and malignant nodules based on U1–5 criteria, and in planning for further investigations. Main messages: • Ultrasound is sensitive in identifying suspicious features, which require aspiration. • Whether nodules require aspiration should be based on sonographic features and clinical findings. • U1–5 classification of sonographic findings can help determine whether aspiration is necessary.","author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Nia"},{"family":"LaPorte","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"xieUltrasonographyThyroidNodules2016","container-title":"Insights into Imaging","DOI":"10.1007/s13244-015-0446-5","ISSN":"18694101","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,1]]},"page":"77-86","publisher":"Springer Verlag","title":"Ultrasonography of thyroid nodules: a pictorial review","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"xingBRAFMutationThyroid2005","abstract":"Genetic alteration is the driving force for thyroid tumorigenesis and progression, based upon which novel approaches to the management of thyroid cancer can be developed. A recent important genetic finding in thyroid cancer is the oncogenic T1799A transversion mutation of BRAF (the gene for the B-type Raf kinase, BRAF). Since the initial report of this mutation in thyroid cancer 2 years ago, rapid advancements have been made. BRAF mutation is the most common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer, occurring in about 45% of sporadic papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs), particularly in the relatively aggressive subtypes, such as the tall-cell PTC. This mutation is mutually exclusive with other common genetic alterations, supporting its independent oncogenic role, as demonstrated by transgenic mouse studies that showed BRAF mutation-initiated development of PTC and its transition to anaplastic thyroid cancer. BRAF mutation is mutually exclusive with RET/PTC rearrangement, and also displays a reciprocal age association with this common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer. The T1799A BRAF mutation occurs exclusively in PTC and PTC-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer and is a specific diagnostic marker for this cancer when identified in cytological and histological specimens. This mutation is associated with a poorer clinicopathological outcome and is a novel independent molecular prognostic marker in the risk evaluation of thyroid cancer. Moreover, preclinical and clinical evaluations of the therapeutic value of novel specific mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitors in thyroid cancer are anticipated.

Ultrasonography (US) is the most common method of identifying thyroid nodules, but US images require an experienced surgeon for identification. Many artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as computer-aided diagnostic systems (CAD), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) have been used to assist in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, but whether AI techniques can improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid nodules still needs to be explored. Objective. To clarify the accuracy of AI-based thyroid nodule US images for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Methods. A search strategy of \"subject terms + key words\"was used to search PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine (CBM), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for studies on AI-assisted diagnosis of thyroid nodules based on US images. The summarized receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and the pooled sensitivity and specificity were used to assess the performance of the diagnostic tests. The quality assessment of diagnostics accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 15 were used to process the data. Subgroup analysis was based on the integrity of data collection. Results. A total of 25 studies with 17,429 US images of thyroid nodules were included. AI-assisted diagnostic techniques had better diagnostic efficacy in the diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules: sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI: (0.85-0.90)), specificity 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74-0.86), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 30 (95% CI: 19-46). The SROC curve indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94). Threshold effect analysis showed a Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.17 < 0.5, suggesting no threshold effect for the included studies. After a meta-regression analysis of 4 different subgroups, the results showed a statistically significant effect of mean age ≥50 years on heterogeneity. Compared with studies with an average age of ≥50 years, AI-assisted diagnostic techniques had higher diagnostic performance in studies with an average age of <50 years (0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.92) vs. 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73-0.88)), (0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.88) vs. 0.73 (95% CI: 0.60-0.87)).

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 192 biopsy-confirmed thyroid nodules (175 benign, 17 malignant) in 167 unique patients (mean age, 56 years 6 16 [SD], 137 women) undergoing cine US between April 2017 and May 2018 with American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS)–structured radiology reports were evaluated. A deep learn-ing–based system that exploits the cine images obtained during three-dimensional volumetric thyroid scans and outputs malignancy risk was developed and compared, using fivefold cross-validation, against a two-dimensional (2D) deep learning–based model (Static-2DCNN), a radiomics-based model using cine images (Cine-Radiomics), and the ACR TI-RADS level, with histopathologic diagnosis as ground truth. The system was used to revise the ACR TI-RADS recommendation, and its diagnostic performance was compared against the original ACR TI-RADS. Results: The system achieved higher average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC, 0.88) than Static-2DCNN (0.72, P = .03) and tended toward higher average AUC than Cine-Radiomics (0.78, P = .16) and ACR TI-RADS level (0.80, P = .21). The system downgraded recommendations for 92 benign and two malignant nodules and upgraded none. The revised recommendation achieved higher specificity (139 of 175, 79.4%) than the original ACR TI-RADS (47 of 175, 26.9%; P < .001), with no difference in sensitivity (12 of 17, 71% and 14 of 17, 82%, respectively; P = .63).

Thus, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system to automatically classify the four patterns of thyroid scintigram. Methods: We collected 3087 thyroid scintigrams from center 1 to construct the training dataset (n = 2468) and internal validating dataset (n = 619), and another 302 cases from center 2 as external validating datasets. Four pre-trained neural networks that included ResNet50, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 were implemented to construct AI models. The models were trained separately with transfer learning. We evaluated each model’s performance with metrics as following: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), recall, precision, and F1-score. Results: The overall accuracy of four pre-trained neural networks in classifying four common uptake patterns of thyroid scintigrams all exceeded 90%, and the InceptionV3 stands out from others. It reached the highest performance with an overall accuracy of 92.73% for internal validation and 87.75% for external validation, respectively. As for each category of thyroid scintigrams, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.986 for ‘diffusely increased,’ 0.997 for ‘diffusely decreased,’ 0.998 for ‘focal increased,’ and 0.945 for ‘heterogeneous uptake’ in internal validation, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding performances also obtained an ideal result of 0.939, 1.000, 0.974, and 0.915 in external validation, respectively.

The predictive power of the CAD value and final multivariable model for the BRAFV600E mutation in thyroid cancer were measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results In this study, 380 (81%) patients were positive and 89 (19%) patients were negative for the BRAFV600E mutation. On multivariate analysis, older age (OR = 1.025, p = 0.018), smaller size (OR = 0.963, p = 0.006), and higher CAD value (OR = 1.016, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with the BRAFV600E mutation. The CAD value yielded an AUC of 0.646 (95% CI: 0.576, 0.716) for predicting the BRAFV600E mutation, while the multivariable model yielded an AUC of 0.706 (95% CI: 0.576, 0.716). The multivariable model showed significantly better performance than the CAD value alone (p = 0.004). Conclusion Deep learning-based CAD for thyroid US can help us predict the BRAFV600E mutation in thyroid cancer. More multi-center studies with more cases are needed to further validate our study results.","author":[{"family":"Yoon","given":"Jiyoung"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Eunjung"},{"family":"Koo","given":"Ja Seung"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Jung Hyun"},{"family":"Nam","given":"Kee Hyun"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jandee"},{"family":"Jo","given":"Young Suk"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Hee Jung"},{"family":"Park","given":"Vivian Youngjean"},{"family":"Kwak","given":"Jin Young"}],"citation-key":"yoonArtificialIntelligencePredict2020","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0242806","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"11 November","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,1]]},"PMID":"33237975","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Artificial intelligence to predict the BRAFV600E mutation in patients with thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"yoonContributionComputedTomography2011","abstract":"Background: To evaluate the most accurate criteria using ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in predicting lateral lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods: A total of 122 lateral cervical lymph nodes of 113 patients diagnosed with PTC underwent preoperative US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) and CT. Degree of enhancement (DOE) was calculated by the differences of Hounsfield units (HU) between the lymph node and the ipsilateral sternocleiomastoideus muscle. Standard reference was set by surgical pathology results. Diagnostic performances of US, CT, and cutoff value for DOE were analyzed. Results: Seventy lymph nodes (57.4%) were metastases, and 52 (42.6%) were benign. The cutoff value of DOE on CT was 35.7 HU. Diagnostic performance of CT including DOE of 35.7 HU was lower than US, but without significance (P = 0.321). When any suspicious CT feature was combined with the combination of suspicious US features, values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve decreased compared to the combinations of suspicious US features alone, 0.785 to 0.741, respectively (P = 0.225).

  {"id":"yoonImplicationsUSRadiomics","abstract":"Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of the radiomics score using US images to predict malignancy in AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN nodules. Methods One hundred fifty-five indeterminate thyroid nodules in 154 patients who received initial US-guided FNA for diagnostic purposes were included in this retrospective study. A representative US image of each tumor was acquired, and square ROIs covering the whole nodule were drawn using the Paint program of Windows 7. Texture features were extracted by in-house texture analysis algorithms implemented in MATLAB 2019b. The LASSO logistic regression model was used to choose the most useful predictive features, and tenfold cross-validation was performed. Two prediction models were constructed using multivariable logistic regression analysis: one based on clinical variables, and the other based on clinical variables with the radiomics score. Predictability of the two models was assessed with the AUC of the ROC curves. Results Clinical characteristics did not significantly differ between malignant and benign nodules, except for mean nodule size. Among 730 candidate texture features generated from a single US image, 15 features were selected. Radiomics signatures were constructed with a radiomics score, using selected features. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, higher radiomics score was associated with malignancy (OR = 10.923; p < 0.001). The AUC of the malignancy prediction model composed of clinical variables with the radiomics score was significantly higher than the model composed of clinical variables alone (0.839 vs 0.583).

  {"id":"yoonUnusualMetastasesDifferentiated2020","abstract":"Background Although infrequent, distant metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancer is the main cause of mortality in patients and mostly involves the lung, bone, and brain. Distant metastases to other sites in differentiated thyroid cancer patients are rare, thus, the clinical course of unusual metastases has not been adequately researched. In the present study, the clinicopathological findings and treatment outcomes of unusual metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer patients in Korea were evaluated. Patients and methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of differentiated thyroid cancer patients with unusual metastases in four Korean tertiary hospitals (Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Asan Medical Center, Busan National University Hospital, Severance Hospital). Unusual metastases were diagnosed using (1) cytology or histology and/or (2) imaging studies including fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography and/or iodine 131 whole body scans with simultaneously elevated serum levels of thyroglobulin. The pathological findings of primary thyroid cancer, diagnostic method for unusual metastases, and treatment responses of unusual metastases were examined. Results In all, 25 unusual metastatic foci of 19 patients were analyzed; 13 patients (68.4%) had papillary thyroid carcinoma including 4 follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinomas. The median time interval between the first diagnosis of primary thyroid cancer and unusual metastases diagnosis was 110 months (11.0–138.0 months). Only 4 patients (21.1%) had synchronous unusual metastases and 6 patients (31.6%) were symptomatic. Unusual metastases included 19 metastases to solid organs (6 to kidney, 5 to liver, 4 to pancreas, 3 to adrenal gland, and 1 to ovary) and 6 to the skin and muscles. Unusual metastases were pathologically proven in 10 patients (52.6%) and 11 of 16 patients (68.8%) who received iodine 131 whole body scans had radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Among 5 patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 4 treated with lenvatinib showed stable disease or a partial response at the first treatment response. Six patients (31.6%) died due to disease progression during the median 20.0-month follow-up period (11.0–55.0 months). Conclusion Unusual metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer are thought to be underestimated due to disease rarity and their metachronous nature with other distant metastases. The most of unusual metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer patients are existed with usual distant metastasis and clinical outcomes of those could not be significantly different from the prognosis of usual distant metastasis.","author":[{"family":"Yoon","given":"Jee Hee"},{"family":"Jeon","given":"Min Ji"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Mijin"},{"family":"Ram Hong","given":"A."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hee Kyung"},{"family":"Shin","given":"Dong Yeob"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Bo Hyun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Won Bae"},{"family":"Shong","given":"Young Kee"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Ho Cheol"}],"citation-key":"yoonUnusualMetastasesDifferentiated2020","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0238207","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"8 August","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"PMID":"32841270","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Unusual metastases from differentiated thyroid cancers: A multicenter study in Korea","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

The application of AI and radiomics to thyroid cancer diagnosis is examined in this review. A review of multiple databases was conducted in compliance with PRISMA guidelines until October 2023. A combination of keywords led to the discovery of an English academic publication on thyroid cancer and related subjects. 267 papers were returned from the original search after 109 duplicates were removed. Relevant studies were selected according to predetermined criteria after 124 articles were eliminated based on an examination of their abstract and title. After the comprehensive analysis, an additional six studies were excluded. Among the 28 included studies, radiomics analysis, which incorporates ultrasound (US) images, demonstrated its effectiveness in diagnosing thyroid cancer. Various results were noted, some of the studies presenting new strategies that outperformed the status quo. The literature has emphasized various challenges faced by AI models, including interpretability issues, dataset constraints, and operator dependence. The synthesized findings of the 28 included studies mentioned the need for standardization efforts and prospective multicenter studies to address these concerns. Furthermore, approaches to overcome these obstacles were identified, such as advances in explainable AI technology and personalized medicine techniques. The review focuses on how AI and radiomics could transform the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. Despite challenges, future research on multidisciplinary cooperation, clinical applicability validation, and algorithm improvement holds the potential to improve patient outcomes and diagnostic precision in the treatment of thyroid cancer.","author":[{"family":"Yousefi","given":"Milad"},{"family":"Maleki","given":"Shadi Farabi"},{"family":"Jafarizadeh","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Youshanlui","given":"Mahya Ahmadpour"},{"family":"Jafari","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Pedrammehr","given":"Siamak"},{"family":"Alizadehsani","given":"Roohallah"},{"family":"Tadeusiewicz","given":"Ryszard"},{"family":"Plawiak","given":"Pawel"}],"citation-key":"yousefiAdvancementsRadiomicsArtificial2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,9]]},"title":"Advancements in Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence for Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07239"},

  {"id":"zhaiGlobalBurdenThyroid2021","abstract":"Background: Thyroid cancer is a growing threat to human health. Few studies have explored trends of thyroid cancer and relationships with social development factors. In this study, we explored the trend and relationship based on GBD. Methods: By using GBD study, we obtained detailed data of thyroid cancer. Incidence, mortality and DALY were used to assess epidemiological characteristics. ASR and EAPC were used to estimate the trend. Results: Globally, the incidence significantly increased from 1990 to 2017, especially in high-income regions. Males and middle SDI region demonstrated a higher increase of age-standardized incidence rates. Unlike incidence trend, mortality trend showed a minor increase, and even showed a decreasing trend in some regions such as Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the DALY trend also demonstrated a slightly increase with an EAPC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.73–0.81). More significant increase of DALY was found in males, middle SDI region and high-income Asia Pacific. The incidence of thyroid cancer peaked in middle-aged people, while the mortality and DALY peaked in elder-aged. Moreover, the proportion of thyroid cancer deaths contributable to high BMI was highest in developed countries and middle-aged people. Conclusions: Thyroid cancer is a public health problem worldwide. Over-diagnosis might be partly responsible for its rising trend. It remains us to revise the guidelines to avoid unnecessary burdens. Moreover, we should pay attention to the risk factors of thyroid cancer. More targeted measures should be formulated to improve potential environmental and lifestyle-related factors which might contribute to rising trend of thyroid cancer.","author":[{"family":"Zhai","given":"Mimi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Long","given":"Jianhai"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Sushun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yamin"}],"citation-key":"zhaiGlobalBurdenThyroid2021","container-title":"Cancer Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/cam4.3970","ISSN":"20457634","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"page":"4542-4554","PMID":"34002931","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc","title":"The global burden of thyroid cancer and its attributable risk factor in 195 countries and territories: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Methods: A total of 3,198 cases (1,435 males and 1,763 females) between 2004 and 2015 with initial distant metastasis were obtained from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database. Patients with a median follow up time of 13 months and a median age of 66 years were analyzed. A total of 1,407 cases had detailed information regarding the four most common metastatic organs after the year 2010. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analyses, log-rank tests, Cox regression, and logistic regression analyses were used. Results: Among the whole cohort, 33.4% (1,069/3,198), 14.5% (464/3,198), 10.1% (322/3,198), 34.2% (1,094/3,198), and 7.8% (249/3,198) of the patients were at the stage of N0, NX, N1a, N1b, and N1NOS (referring to metastasis to regional lymph nodes but not otherwise specified), respectively. The KM curves demonstrated that the patients at the NX stage had the worst survival. The NX and N1b groups had the highest hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.83 (95%CI 1.46-2.31) and 1.78 (95%CI 1.52-2.10) after adjusting age, race, gender, and tumor size (p < 0.001) compared with N0 group. The lung was the most common metastatic site, with a rate of 51.2% (720/1,407). Compared with the N0 group, N1 patients had higher odds (OR 1.63, 95%CI 1.31-2.01, p < 0.001) for lung metastasis. Similar results were obtained in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) sub-cohort. Conclusions: Overall, the TC patients at the NX stage had the highest mortality risk, followed by N1b, N1a, and N0 groups. Compared with N0 patients, N1 patients were more likely to have lung metastasis. The poor prognosis for TC patients with the NX stage may make more aggressive treatment reasonable.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Junyi"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Xiaoyun"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingchun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xiaoting"},{"family":"Qu","given":"Shen"}],"citation-key":"zhangAssociationLymphNode2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2020.00090","ISSN":"16642392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,27]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"The Association Between Lymph Node Stage and Clinical Prognosis in Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"zhangDataBasedLineTrip2017","abstract":"Power system faults are significant problems in power transmission and distribution. Methods based on relay protection actions and electrical component actions have been put forward in recent years. However, they have deficiencies dealing with power system fault. In this paper, a method for data-based line trip fault prediction in power systems using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. The temporal features of multisourced data are captured with LSTM networks, which perform well in extracting the features of time series for a long-time span. The strong learning and mining ability of LSTM networks is suitable for a large quantity of time series in power transmission and distribution. SVM, with a strong generalization ability and robustness, is introduced for classification to get the final prediction results. Considering the overfitting problem in fault prediction, layer of dropout and batch normalization are added into the network. The complete network architecture is shown in this paper in detail. The parameters are adjusted to fit the specific situation of the actual power system. The data for experiments are obtained from the Wanjiang substation in the China Southern Power Grid.

  {"id":"zhangDeepLearningBasedSurvivalPrediction2024","abstract":"<p>Background This study acquired data pertaining to individuals diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer (TC) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Subsequently, a deep learning and neural network model known as DeepSurv was employed to forecast the survival rate of TC patients and assess its efficacy. Methods Information on individuals diagnosed with TC from the years 2000 to 2019 was collected from the SEER database. The individuals in question were subsequently allocated into training and testing cohorts through a random selection process, maintaining a ratio of 7:3. The outcomes of the DeepSurv model were compared to those of the Cox proportional-hazards (CoxPH) model in order to estimate the chances of survival for TC patients. The accuracy of the model's predictions was evaluated through the examination of calibration curves, the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the concordance index (C-index). Results A total of 25,797 individuals diagnosed with TC were included in this study, with 18,057 comprising the training group and 7,740 forming the testing cohort. The CoxPH model exhibited robust correlations between age, gender, marital status, surgical intervention, radiation therapy, tumor extension, and the survival outcomes of TC patients. Notably, the C-index for the CoxPH model was 0.884, indicating a high level of predictive accuracy. Additionally, the training cohort data were used to create the DeepSurv model, which produced a higher C-index of 0.904. The predictive performance of both models was assessed, and the 3-, 5-, and 8-year AUC values were calculated.

  {"id":"zhangIntegratingBRAFV600EMutation2022","abstract":"Background: The advantages of prophylactic central lymph node dissection (CLND) for clinically node-negative patients remained a great deal of controversies. Our research was aimed to analyze the relationship between cervical central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) and BRAFV600E mutation, ultrasonic and clinicopathologic characterizes in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods and materials: In current study, a total of 112 consecutive PTC patients who experienced thyroidectomy plus cervical central neck dissection were included in our research. All PTC were pre-operatively analyzed by ultrasonic features, including tumor size, multifocality or not, tumor location, internal components, echogenicity, microcalcification, margins, orientation, taller than wide shape, and internal vascularity. The presence of clinicopathologic factors, including age, sex, T stage, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and BRAFV600E mutation was then investigated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to check into the relationship between predictive factors and cervical CLNM in PTC patients, and then a predictive model was also established. Results: Pathologically, 58.0% (65/112) of the PTC patients harbored cervical CLNM. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to identify age < 55 years, tumor size > 10 mm, microcalcification, non-concomitant Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and BRAFV600E mutation were predictive factors for cervical CLNM in PTC. The risk score for cervical CLNM in PTC patients was calculated: risk score = 1.284 × (if age < 55 years) + 1.241 × (if tumor size > 10 mm) + 1.143 × (if microcalcification) – 2.097 × (if concomitant Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) + 1.628 × (if BRAFV600E mutation). Conclusion: Age < 55 years old, PTC > 10 mm, microcalcification, non-concomitant Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and BRAFV600E mutation are predictive factors for cervical CLNM.

  {"id":"zhangMultichannelConvolutionalNeural2022","abstract":"Early detection of malignant thyroid nodules leading to patient-specific treatments can reduce morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, thyroid specialists use medical images to diagnose then follow the treatment protocols, which have limitations due to unreliable human false-positive diagnostic rates. With the emergence of deep learning, advances in computer-aided diagnosis techniques have yielded promising earlier detection and prediction accuracy; however, clinicians' adoption is far lacking. The present study adopts Xception neural network as the base structure and designs a practical framework, which comprises three adaptable multi-channel architectures that were positively evaluated using real-world data sets. The proposed architectures outperform existing statistical and machine learning techniques and reached a diagnostic accuracy rate of 0.989 with ultrasound images and 0.975 with computed tomography scans through the single input dual-channel architecture. Moreover, the patient-specific design was implemented for thyroid cancer detection and has obtained an accuracy of 0.95 for double inputs dual-channel architecture and 0.94 for four-channel architecture. Our evaluation suggests that ultrasound images and computed tomography (CT) scans yield comparable diagnostic results through computer-aided diagnosis applications. With ultrasound images obtained slightly higher results, CT, on the other hand, can achieve the patient-specific diagnostic design. Besides, with the proposed framework, clinicians can select the best fitting architecture when making decisions regarding a thyroid cancer diagnosis. The proposed framework also incorporates interpretable results as evidence, which potentially improves clinicians' trust and hence their adoption of the computer-aided diagnosis techniques proposed with increased efficiency and accuracy.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Vincent C.S."},{"family":"Rong","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Haoyu"}],"citation-key":"zhangMultichannelConvolutionalNeural2022","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0262128","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"1 January","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"PMID":"35061759","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Multi-channel convolutional neural network architectures for thyroid cancer detection","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"zhangRadiomicsItsFeature2023","abstract":"Medical imaging plays an indispensable role in evaluating, predicting, and monitoring a range of medical conditions. Radiomics, a specialized branch of medical imaging, utilizes quantitative features extracted from medical images to describe underlying pathologies, genetic information, and prognostic indicators. The integration of radiomics with artificial intelligence presents innovative avenues for cancer diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and therapeutic choices. In the context of oncology, radiomics offers significant potential. Feature selection emerges as a pivotal step, enhancing the clinical utility and precision of radiomics. It achieves this by purging superfluous and unrelated features, thereby augmenting model performance and generalizability. The goal of this review is to assess the fundamental radiomics process and the progress of feature selection methods, explore their applications and challenges in cancer research, and provide theoretical and methodological support for future investigations. Through an extensive literature survey, articles pertinent to radiomics and feature selection were garnered, synthesized, and appraised. The paper provides detailed descriptions of how radiomics is applied and challenged in different cancer types and their various stages. The review also offers comparative insights into various feature selection strategies, including filtering, packing, and embedding methodologies. Conclusively, the paper broaches the limitations and prospective trajectories of radiomics.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wenchao"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Qiyu"}],"citation-key":"zhangRadiomicsItsFeature2023","container-title":"Symmetry","DOI":"10.3390/sym15101834","ISSN":"20738994","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","title":"Radiomics and Its Feature Selection: A Review","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"zhangResidualDenseNetwork2018","abstract":"A very deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently achieved great success for image super-resolution (SR) and offered hierarchical features as well. However, most deep CNN based SR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-resolution (LR) images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in image SR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via dense connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory (CM) mechanism. Local feature fusion in RDB is then used to adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilizes the training of wider network. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with different degradation models show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yulun"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Yapeng"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Bineng"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Yun"}],"citation-key":"zhangResidualDenseNetwork2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,23]]},"title":"Residual Dense Network for Image Super-Resolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08797"},
  {"id":"zhangReviewDeepLearning2019","abstract":"Deep learning has attracted intense interest in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), because of its enormous representing power, automated feature learning capability and best-in-class performance in solving complex problems. This paper surveys recent advancements in PHM methodologies using deep learning with the aim of identifying research gaps and suggesting further improvements. After a brief introduction to several deep learning models, we review and analyze applications of fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis using deep learning. The survey validates the universal applicability of deep learning to various types of input in PHM, including vibration, imagery, time-series and structured data. It also reveals that deep learning provides a one-fits-all framework for the primary PHM subfields: Fault detection uses either reconstruction error or stacks a binary classifier on top of the network to detect anomalies; fault diagnosis typically adds a soft-max layer to perform multi-class classification; prognosis adds a continuous regression layer to predict remaining useful life. The general framework suggests the possibility of transfer learning across PHM applications. The survey reveals some common properties and identifies the research gaps in each PHM subfield. It concludes by summarizing some major challenges and potential opportunities in the domain.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liangwei"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhicong"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Xiaohui"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Muheng"}],"citation-key":"zhangReviewDeepLearning2019","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950985","ISSN":"21693536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"162415-162438","publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","title":"A Review on Deep Learning Applications in Prognostics and Health Management","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"zhangRiskFactorsDiagnostic2022","abstract":"Thyroid nodules (TNs) represent a common scenario. More accurate pre-operative diagnosis of malignancy has become an overriding concern. This study incorporated demographic, serological, ultrasound, and biopsy data and aimed to compare a new diagnostic prediction model based on Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) with multivariate logistic regression model, to guide the decision of surgery. Records of 2,090 patients with TNs who underwent thyroid surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that Bethesda category (OR=1.90, P<0.001), TIRADS (OR=2.55, P<0.001), age (OR=0.97, P=0.002), nodule size (OR=0.53, P<0.001), and serum levels of Tg (OR=0.994, P=0.004) and HDL-C (OR=0.23, P=0.001) were statistically significant independent differentiators for patients with PTC and benign nodules. Both BPNN and regression models showed good accuracy in differentiating PTC from benign nodules (area under the curve [AUC], 0.948 and 0.924, respectively). Notably, the BPNN model showed a higher specificity (88.3% vs. 73.9%) and negative predictive value (83.7% vs. 45.8%) than the regression model, while the sensitivity (93.1% vs. 93.9%) was similar between two models. Stratified analysis based on Bethesda indeterminate cytology categories showed similar findings. Therefore, BPNN and regression models based on a combination of demographic, serological, ultrasound, and biopsy data, all of which were readily available in routine clinical practice, might help guide the decision of surgery for TNs.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaowen"},{"family":"Ze","given":"Yuyang"},{"family":"Sang","given":"Jianfeng"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Xianbiao"},{"family":"Bi","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Shanmei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xinlin"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Dalong"}],"citation-key":"zhangRiskFactorsDiagnostic2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2022.938008","ISSN":"16642392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,5]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Risk factors and diagnostic prediction models for papillary thyroid carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"zhaoDiagnosisThyroidDisease2023","abstract":"Objectives: The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic performance of nuclear medicine physicians using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model and validate the results with two multicenter datasets for thyroid disease by analyzing clinical single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image data. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 3194 SPECT thyroid images were collected for model training (n=2067), internal validation (n=514) and external validation (n=613). First, four pretrained DCNN models (AlexNet, ShuffleNetV2, MobileNetV3 and ResNet-34) for were tested multiple medical image classification of thyroid disease types (i.e., Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, thyroid tumor and normal thyroid). The best performing model was then subjected to fivefold cross-validation to further assess its performance, and the diagnostic performance of this model was compared with that of junior and senior nuclear medicine physicians. Finally, class-specific attentional regions were visualized with attention heatmaps using gradient-weighted class activation mapping. Results: Each of the four pretrained neural networks attained an overall accuracy of more than 0.85 for the classification of SPECT thyroid images. The improved ResNet-34 model performed best, with an accuracy of 0.944. For the internal validation set, the ResNet-34 model showed higher accuracy (p < 0.001) when compared to that of the senior nuclear medicine physician, with an improvement of nearly 10%. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.931 for the external dataset, a significantly higher accuracy than that of the senior physician (0.931 vs. 0.868, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The DCNN-based model performed well in terms of diagnosing thyroid scintillation images. The DCNN model showed higher sensitivity and greater specificity in identifying Graves’ disease, subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid tumors compared to those of nuclear medicine physicians, illustrating the feasibility of deep learning models to improve the diagnostic efficiency for assisting clinicians.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Huayi"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Chenxi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Huihui"},{"family":"Rao","given":"Maohua"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yixuan"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Danzhou"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jiahui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wenqian"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Gengbiao"}],"citation-key":"zhaoDiagnosisThyroidDisease2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2023.1224191","ISSN":"16642392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","title":"Diagnosis of thyroid disease using deep convolutional neural network models applied to thyroid scintigraphy images: a multicenter study","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"zhaoEffectProphylacticCentral2017","abstract":"Background: The use of prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) without clinical evidence of nodal metastasis (cN0) remains controversial. This study was designed to examine whether pCND for PTC affected locoregional recurrence (LRR). Methods: A systematic review was performed to compare the LRR between patients with PTC who underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) and pCND and those who underwent TT alone. The primary outcome was LRR. Other outcomes, including postoperative radioiodine (RAI) ablation and surgically related complications, were evaluated. A meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. Results: We included 17 studies, which comprised 4437 patients. Patients in the TT+pCND group had a significantly reduced risk of LRR (risk ratio [RR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49–0.90; P = 0.008). The LRR in the central neck compartment (RR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.18–0.68; P = 0.002) was significantly lower in the TT+pCND group, whereas the LRR in the lateral neck compartment was similar between the two groups. Compared with the TT alone group, patients in the TT+pCND group tended to receive higher RAI (74.6% vs. 59.9%) and experience temporary hypocalcemia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37; 95% CI 1.89–2.96; P < 0.00001), permanent hypocalcemia (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 1.05–3.57; P = 0.03), and increased overall morbidity (OR = 2.56; 95% CI 1.75–3.74; P < 0.00001). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested that although pCND reduced the LRR in PTC—specifically in the central neck compartment—it was accompanied by an increased rate of postoperative hypocalcemia. However, the evidence is limited and randomized, controlled trials are needed to clarify this role further.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wenjing"},{"family":"You","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Xianming"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shaobo"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Xiaoxia"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ge"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yupei"}],"citation-key":"zhaoEffectProphylacticCentral2017","container-title":"Annals of Surgical Oncology","DOI":"10.1245/s10434-016-5691-4","ISSN":"15344681","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,1]]},"page":"2189-2198","PMID":"27913945","publisher":"Springer New York LLC","title":"The Effect of Prophylactic Central Neck Dissection on Locoregional Recurrence in Papillary Thyroid Cancer After Total Thyroidectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: pCND for the Locoregional Recurrence of Papillary Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

Methods: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify relevant studies up to Sep. 2017. Overall sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were used to assess the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound in detecting central and lateral CLNM of PTC. Results: Nineteen studies comprising 4014 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR and area under curve (AUC) of ultrasound in detecting central CLNM were 0.33 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.31–0.35), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92–0.94), 5.63 (95% CI: 3.50–9.04), and 0.69, respectively; and lateral CLNM were 0.70 (95% CI: 0.68–0.72), 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82–0.85), 18.7 (95% CI: 10.3–33.9) and 0.88, respectively. We found that the rate of central CLNM of PTC was 48.0%, and 36.2% of the dissected lymph nodes were metastatic, meanwhile, the rate of lateral CLNM of PTC was 59.2%, and 46.6% of the dissected lymph nodes were metastatic in the meta-analysis. Conclusions: Preoperative ultrasound demonstrates poor sensitivity in the diagnosis of central CLNM, and good diagnostic efficacy for lateral CLNM of PTC.

Recent advances in genome-wide profiling provide an opportunity to investigate global molecular changes during the development and progression of cancer. Meanwhile, numerous statistical and machine learning algorithms have been designed for the processing and interpretation of high-throughput molecular data. Molecular subtyping studies have allowed the allocation of cancer into homogeneous groups that are considered to harbor similar molecular and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, this has helped researchers to identify both actionable targets for drug design as well as biomarkers for response prediction. In this review, we introduce five frequently applied techniques for generating molecular data, which are microarray, RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, NanoString and tissue microarray. Commonly used molecular data for cancer subtyping and clinical applications are discussed. Next, we summarize a workflow for molecular subtyping of cancer, including data preprocessing, cluster analysis, supervised classification and subtype characterizations. Finally, we identify and describe four major challenges in the molecular subtyping of cancer that may preclude clinical implementation. We suggest that standardized methods should be established to help identify intrinsic subgroup signatures and build robust classifiers that pave the way toward stratified treatment of cancer patients.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Lan"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Victor H.F."},{"family":"Ng","given":"Michael K."},{"family":"Yan","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Bijlsma","given":"Maarten F."}],"citation-key":"zhaoMolecularSubtypingCancer2019","container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bby026","ISSN":"14774054","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,22]]},"page":"572-584","PMID":"29659698","publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Molecular subtyping of cancer: Current status and moving toward clinical applications","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"zhouDifferentialDiagnosisBenign2020","abstract":"Purpose: We aimed to propose a highly automatic and objective model named deep learning Radiomics of thyroid (DLRT) for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules from ultrasound (US) images. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled and finally include US images and fine-needle aspiration biopsies from 1734 patients with 1750 thyroid nodules. A basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a transfer learning (TL) model, and a newly designed model named deep learning Radiomics of thyroid (DLRT) were used for the investigation. Their diagnostic accuracy was further compared with human observers (one senior and one junior US radiologist). Moreover, the robustness of DLRT over different US instruments was also validated. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to calculate optimal area under it (AUC) for benign and malignant nodules. One observer helped to delineate the nodules. Results: AUCs of DLRT were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-0.98), 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-0.97) and 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-0.99) in the training, internal and external validation cohort, respectively, which were significantly better than other deep learning models (P < 0.01) and human observers (P < 0.001). No significant difference was found when applying DLRT on thyroid US images acquired from different US instruments. Conclusions: DLRT shows the best overall performance comparing with other deep learning models and human observers. It holds great promise for improving the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Yinhua"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Meiwu"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Yuqin"},{"family":"wang","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Jianjun"}],"citation-key":"zhouDifferentialDiagnosisBenign2020","container-title":"European Journal of Radiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.108992","ISSN":"18727727","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"PMID":"32339983","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd","title":"Differential Diagnosis of Benign and Malignant Thyroid Nodules Using Deep Learning Radiomics of Thyroid Ultrasound Images","type":"article-journal","volume":"127"},

Methods: This study included 3353 patients who underwent thyroid ultrasound (US) and CEUS in ten multi-centers between September 2018 and March 2020. Based on a modified TI-RADS classification using the CEUS enhancement pattern of thyroid lesions, ten radiologists analyzed all US and CEUS examinations independently and assigned a TI-RADS category to each thyroid nodule. Pathology was the reference standard for determining the diagnostic performance (accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPN), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)) of the modified TI-RADS for predicting malignant thyroid nodules. The risk of malignancy was stratified for each TI-RADS category-based on the total number of benign and malignant lesions in that category. ROC curve was used to determine the cut-off value and the area under the curve (AUC). Cohen’s Kappa statistic was applied to assess the inter-observer agreement of each sonological feature and TI-RADS category for thyroid nodules. Results: The calculated malignancy risk in the modified TI-RADS categories 5, 4b, 4a, 3 and 2 nodules was 95.4%, 86.0%, 12.0%, 4.1% and 0%, respectively. The malignancy risk for the five categories was in agreement with the suggested malignancy risk. The ROC curve showed that the AUC under the ROC curve was 0.936, and the cutoff value of the modified TI-RADS classification was >TI-RADS 4a, whose SEN, ACC, PPV, NPV and SPN were 93.6%, 91.9%, 90.4%, 93.7% and 88.5% respectively. The Kappa value for taller than wide, microcalcification, marked hypoechoic, solid composition, irregular margins and enhancement pattern of CEUS was 0.94, 0.93, 0.75, 0.89, 0.86 and 0.81, respectively. There was also good agreement between the observers with regards to the modified TI-RADS classification, the Kappa value was 0.80. Conclusions: The actual risk of malignancy according to the modified TI-RADS concurred with the suggested risk of malignancy. Inter-observer agreement for the modified TI-RADS category was good, thus suggesting that this classification was very suitable for clinical application.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Lifeng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhiyuan"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xueling"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Heng"},{"family":"Tao","given":"Yichao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wengang"}],"citation-key":"zhouUseModifiedTIRADS2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2023.1080908","ISSN":"1664-2392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"The use of modified TI-RADS using contrast-enhanced ultrasound features for classification purposes in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules: A prospective and multi-center study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1080908/full","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"zhuEfficientDeepConvolutional2021","abstract":"Background: The aim of this study was to construct a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for localization and diagnosis of thyroid nodules on ultrasound and evaluate its diagnostic performance. Methods: We developed and trained a deep CNN model called the Brief Efficient Thyroid Network (BETNET) using 16,401 ultrasound images. According to the parameters of the model, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to localize and differentiate thyroid nodules. The validation dataset (1,000 images) was used to compare the diagnostic performance of the model using three state-of-the-art algorithms. We used an internal test set (300 images) to evaluate the BETNET model by comparing it with diagnoses from five radiologists with varying degrees of experience in thyroid nodule diagnosis. Lastly, we demonstrated the general applicability of our artificial intelligence (AI) system for diagnosing thyroid cancer in an external test set (1,032 images). Results: The BETNET model accurately detected thyroid nodules in visualization experiments. The model demonstrated higher values for area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve [0.983, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.973–0.990], sensitivity (99.19%), accuracy (98.30%), and Youden index (0.9663) than the three state-of-the-art algorithms (P<0.05). In the internal test dataset, the diagnostic accuracy of the BETNET model was 91.33%, which was markedly higher than the accuracy of one experienced (85.67%) and two less experienced radiologists (77.67% and 69.33%). The area under the ROC curve of the BETNET model (0.951) was similar to that of the two highly skilled radiologists (0.940 and 0.953) and significantly higher than that of one experienced and two less experienced radiologists (P<0.01). The kappa coefficient of the BETNET model and the pathology results showed good agreement (0.769). In addition, the BETNET model achieved an excellent diagnostic performance (AUC =0.970, 95% CI: 0.958–0.980) when applied to ultrasound images from another independent hospital. Conclusions: We developed a deep learning model which could accurately locate and automatically diagnose thyroid nodules on ultrasound images. The BETNET model exhibited better diagnostic performance than three state-of-the-art algorithms, which in turn performed similarly in diagnosis as the experienced radiologists. The BETNET model has the potential to be applied to ultrasound images from other hospitals.","author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jialin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Ruiguo"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhiqiang"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Hongyan"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xun"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Xiangqian"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Xi"}],"citation-key":"zhuEfficientDeepConvolutional2021","container-title":"Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery","DOI":"10.21037/qims-20-538","ISSN":"22234306","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"page":"1368-1380","publisher":"AME Publishing Company","title":"An efficient deep convolutional neural network model for visual localization and automatic diagnosis of thyroid nodules on ultrasound images","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"zhuGenericDeepLearning2021","abstract":"Breast and thyroid cancers are the two common cancers to affect women worldwide. Ultrasonography (US) is a commonly used non-invasive imaging modality to detect breast and thyroid cancers, but its clinical diagnostic accuracy for these cancers is controversial. Both thyroid and breast cancers share some similar high frequency ultrasound characteristics such as taller-than-wide shape ratio, hypo-echogenicity, and ill-defined margins. This study aims to develop an automatic scheme for classifying thyroid and breast lesions in ultrasound images using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). In particular, we propose a generic DCNN architecture with transfer learning and the same architectural parameter settings to train models for thyroid and breast cancers (TNet and BNet) respectively, and test the viability of such a generic approach with ultrasound images collected from clinical practices. In addition, the potentials of the thyroid model in learning the common features and its performance of classifying both breast and thyroid lesions are investigated. A retrospective dataset of 719 thyroid and 672 breast images captured from US machines of different makes between October 2016 and December 2018 is used in this study. Test results show that both TNet and BNet built on the same DCNN architecture have achieved good classification results (86.5% average accuracy for TNet and 89% for BNet). Furthermore, we used TNet to classify breast lesions and the model achieves sensitivity of 86.6% and specificity of 87.1%, indicating its capability in learning features commonly shared by thyroid and breast lesions. We further tested the diagnostic performance of the TNet model against that of three radiologists. The area under curve (AUC) for thyroid nodule classification is 0.861 (95% CI: 0.792–0.929) for the TNet model and 0.757–0.854 (95% CI: 0.658–0.934) for the three radiologists. The AUC for breast cancer classification is 0.875 (95% CI: 0.804–0.947) for the TNet model and 0.698–0.777 (95% CI: 0.593–0.872) for the radiologists, indicating the model's potential in classifying both breast and thyroid cancers with a higher level of accuracy than that of radiologists.","author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yi Cheng"},{"family":"AlZoubi","given":"Alaa"},{"family":"Jassim","given":"Sabah"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Quan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yong Bing"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Xian De"},{"family":"DU","given":"Hongbo"}],"citation-key":"zhuGenericDeepLearning2021","container-title":"Ultrasonics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106300","ISSN":"0041624X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"PMID":"33232887","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"A generic deep learning framework to classify thyroid and breast lesions in ultrasound images","type":"article-journal","volume":"110"},
