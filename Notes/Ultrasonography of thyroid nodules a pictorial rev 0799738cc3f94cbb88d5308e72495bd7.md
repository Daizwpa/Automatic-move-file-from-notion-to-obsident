Status: In progress
Task: Thyroid nodule studies
Type of paper: review paper

Objective:

- The aim is to assist radiologists and clinicians in recognising sonographic patterns of benign, suspicious and malignant nodules based on U1-5 criteria, and in planning for further investigations.

Main  messages:

- Ultrasound is sensitive in identifying suspicious features, which require aspiration.
- Whether nodules require aspiration should be based on sonographic features and clinical findings.
- U1-5 classification of sonographic findings can help determine whether aspiration is necessary.

Quotes:

- US provides a safe and fast method of examination. It is sensitive for the detection of thyroid nodules, and suspicious features can be used to guide further investigation/management decisions. However, given the financial burden on the health service and unnecessary anxiety for patients, it is unrealistic to biopsy every thyroid nodule to confirm diagnosis.
- The British Thyroid Association (BTA) has recently produced a US classification (U1â€“U5) of thyroid nodules to facilitate the decision-making process regarding the need to perform fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for suspicious cases.
- A thyroid nodule is a discrete lesion within the normal thyroid.
- The normal thyroid gland is homogenous and is mildly hyper-echogenic compared to surrounding muscles (Fig. 1).
