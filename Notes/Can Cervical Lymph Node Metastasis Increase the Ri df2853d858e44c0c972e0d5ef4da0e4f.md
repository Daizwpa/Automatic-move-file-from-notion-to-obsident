Objective:

- This study aimed to evaluate the impact of N stage subclassification on different distant metastasis sites based on age stratification, especially for patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma

Results:

- Lung was the most common metastatic site regardless of N0, N1a disease, or N1b disease.
- the N stage increased, the higher the rate of Distant metastasis identified.
- N1b disease significantly increased the risk of lung metastasis (LM; odds ratio, OR = 20.45, P < 0.001) rather than bone metastasis (BM; OR = 3.46, P > 0.05) in younger patients.
- in older patients, N1b disease significantly increased the risk of both LM (OR = 4.10, P < 0.001) and BM (OR = 2.65, P = 0.007).
- In patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), N1a disease did not increase the risk of DM, LM, and BM compared with N0 disease (P > 0.05).
- combined N stage with risk stratification has well performance in predicting DM (area under the curve, AUC = 0.761). Similar results were shown in PTC patients with LM (AUC = 0.770) and BM (AUC = 0.729).

Quote:

- In total, 20.7–62% of patients with PTC present cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) at initial diagnosis.
- the recently updated 8th edition of the TNM staging system eliminates the difference between central (N1a) and lateral (N1b) LNM, and N1b disease is not adopted for the final staging classification (5–7).
- Distant metastasis (DM), including lung metastasis (LM), bone metastasis (BM), brain metastasis, and liver metastasis, contributes to the leading cause of thyroid cancer-related death (8), and the rates of 5- and 10-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) for PTC patients with DM were reported to be 35 and 25%, respectively (9, 10).
- Vuong and his colleagues (15) demonstrated that N1b disease was associated with a significant risk for DM
- In contrast, N1a disease could not increase the risk of DM in patients with PTC.
- Previous studies pointed out that LNM was considered as the strongest predictor of DM (11–13), especially in younger patients (<55 years) (14).

Conclusion:

- Overall, the incidence of DM significantly increased with the progress of N disease after age stratification.
- N1a disease did not increase the risk of DM in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma patients, regardless of LM or BM.
- Combined N stage with risk stratification may be beneficial for DM prediction.
