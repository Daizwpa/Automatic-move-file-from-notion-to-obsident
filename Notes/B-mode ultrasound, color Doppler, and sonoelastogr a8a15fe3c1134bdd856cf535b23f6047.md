Objective:

- The aim of this study  is to compare between B-mode sonography, color Doppler, and sonoelastography in assessment of enlarged deep cervical lymph nodes.

Problematic:

- 

Results:

Conclusion:

- **Ultrasound elastography with its high sensitivity and specificity is a helpful improvement in US for the assessment of cervical lymph nodes, in which biopsies should be performed.**

Quote:

- Unlike Teng et al. [12] found that the best B-mode criterion was short-axis diameter with sensitivity of 94% and accuracy of 71.9%,
