Objective:

- In this study we verified the prognostic value of the BRAFV600E mutation in PTC patients with a long-term follow-up.
- 

Task:

- studied 102 PTC patients with a median follow-up of 15 years.
- The BRAFV600E mutation was analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing.
- The correlation between the presence/absence of the BRAFV600E mutation, clinicopathological features, and outcome of PTC patients were evaluated.

Results:

- The BRAFV600E mutation was found in 38 of 102 (37.3%)
- PTC patients, and was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 years (P 5 0.02), in advanced stages (P 5 0.03), and in cases with vascular invasion (P 5 0.02).
- At univariate analysis the worst outcome for PTC patients was significantly correlated with clinicopathological features (i.e. age, tumor size, extrathyroid extension, lymph node and distant  metastases, advanced stage, vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and vascular invasion) and the BRAFV600E mutation (P , 0.002).

Conclusion:

- In this study the BRAFV600E mutation correlated with the worst outcome for PTC patients, who were not only at a higher risk not to be cured but also for death.
- In particular, the BRAFV600E mutation was demonstrated to be a poor prognostic factor independent from other clinicopathological features.
