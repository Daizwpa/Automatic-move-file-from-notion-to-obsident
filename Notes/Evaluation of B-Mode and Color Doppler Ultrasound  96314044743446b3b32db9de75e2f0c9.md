Status: Done
Task: Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis
Number Of Patient: 166
Type of paper: cross-sectional analytical study

Objective:

- this study was carried to assess the diagnostic role of B-mode ultrasound and color doppler ultrasound in differentiating benign and malignant cervical lymph nodes.

Results:

Conclusion:

- Malignant nodes had significantly higher SAD, higher S/L ratio, loss of echogenic hilum,
presence of ill-defined margins and peripheral/mixed vascularity compared to benign nodes.
The loss of echogenic hilum was the most accurate and sensitive parameter, while the S/L ratio
was found to be the most specific BMUS parameter in the detection of malignant nodes. BMUS
and CDUS identifies malignant nodes, helps in guiding FNAC/biopsy and can potentially reduce
unnecessary biopsies. It also helps in selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient.

- Grayscale ultrasound (US) gives information about the cervical nodal morphological character
like size, shape, borders, echogenicity, etc. [5].
