- Objective:
    - The review is focused mainly on genetic alteration in genes, coding signaling pathways proteins.
    - It is additionally pointed out that genetic, as well as epigenetic DNA changing via aberrant **methylation of several tumour suppressor** and **thyroid-specific genes are associated with tumour aggressiveness**, **being a jointly responsible mechanism for thyroid tumorigenesis.**

- Quotes:
    - The understanding of this molecular mechanism provides access to novel molecular therapeutic strategies for inhibiting oncogenic activity of signaling pathways.
    - **The genes, coding the signaling cascade proteins** (e.g., RET, RAS, BRAF, PI3K, PTEN, AKT), are mutated or aberrantly expressed in thyroid cancer derived from follicular thyroid cell.
    - Genetic and epigenetic alternations, concerning MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, contribute to their activation and interaction in consequence of malignant follicular cell transformation.
    - An identification of molecular alterations, involved in thyroid carcinomas of follicular origin, may help implement novel therapeutic strategies beside surgery and adjuvant radioactive iodine treatment.
    - Many studies have supported that PDTCs display a high tendency to recurrence of symptoms, metastasis and progressive dedifferentiation of follicular cells (4,7-9).
    - Although the results, obtained in many studies, strongly support the progression concept in
    thyroid tumorigenesis, the knowledge about possible molecular mechanisms, underlying this process, is still insufficient. However, there have been studies, assessing the molecular factors that may play an essential role in dedifferentiation of WDTC (6,10,11). These factors affect tumour proliferation, growth, cellular survival, and may contribute to developing of particular thyroid cancer phenotype.

    - MAP Kinase:
        - Definition:
            - RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK/ERK; mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
            signal-regulated kinase) signaling pathway, called ‚ÄúMAPK pathway‚Äù is a classical conserved intracellular signaling pathway that transmits signals which regulate cell differentiation, apoptosis and survival proliferation, (12-14).
            - This pathway functions as family of numerous receptor, non-receptor kinases, GTP-binding proteins *(RAS)* and transcription factors (c-Myc, Ets, CREB, c-Jun, c-Fos), which can be activated or inactivated by protein phosphorylation (14, 15).
            - Activation of this pathway conducts cells into mutator phenotype by increasing cell proliferation and dedifferentiation and inhibition of apoptosis (15,16).
