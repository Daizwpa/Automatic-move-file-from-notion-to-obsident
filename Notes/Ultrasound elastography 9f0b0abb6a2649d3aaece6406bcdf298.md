## Objective:

- we discuss the various techniques separately based on their basic principles, clinical applications in various organs, and advantages and limitations and which might be most appropriate given that the majority of doctors have access to only one kind of machine.

## Quote:

- Physicians have understood the elastic properties of pathology since the first time they used palpation as a diagnostic examination.

- Physicians have used palpation as a diagnostic examination to understand the elastic properties of pathology for a long time since they realized that tissue stiffness is closely related to its biological characteristics.
- US elastography provided new diagnostic information about elasticity comparing with the morphological feathers of traditional US.
- US elastography  expanded the scope of the application in clinic comparing with traditional US.
- The World Federation of Ultrasound Medicine and Biology divided elastographic techniques into strain elastography (SE), transient elastography and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI).
- The ARFI techniques can be further classified into point shear wave elastography (SWE), 2D SWE, and 3D SWE techniques.

- In 1991, Ophir Equate first invented a model of ultrasound (US) elastography,[1] overcoming the weakness of subjectivity by manual palpation and gaining the ability to detect deep lesions as well as superficial masses.
- US elastography provided new diagnostic information about elasticity comparing with the morphological feathers of traditional US, and thus expanded the scope of the application in clinic.
- US elastography is now widely used in the field of diagnosis and differential diagnosis of abnormality, evaluating the degree of fibrosis and assessment of treatment response for a range of diseases.
- The World Federation of Ultrasound Medicine and Biology divided elastography techniques into three major categories according to their different processes:[2]
    - (strain elastography (SE) evaluates tissue deformation by manual compression or physiological motion.
    - transient elastography (TE) generates a shear wave with an external vibration.
    - acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) is a method that uses acoustic radiation force to produce shear waves.
- The ARFI techniques can be further classified into point shear wave elastography (p-SWE), 2D shear wave elastography (2D SWE), and 3D shear wave elastography (3D SWE) techniques.
- The SE measures the strain, while the shear wave-based techniques (including TE and ARFI techniques) measure the speed of shear waves in tissues [Table 1].
- The first commercial equipment for elastography was released in 2003 and has developed rapidly over the last 20 years.
- SE can be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid nodules, combined with traditional US,[14] by several semi-quantitative methods
