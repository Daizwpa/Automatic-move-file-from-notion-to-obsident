Objective:

- to investigate the efﬁcacy of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system in distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules in the context of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and to evaluate the role of the CAD system in reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions.
- 

Problematic:

Task:

- collect 137 ultrasound image of nodule  from 137 patient.
- analyzing collected image by the CAD system and two radiologists with different experiences according to ACR TI-RADS.
- 

Result:

- The accuracy, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, PPV, and NPV of the CAD system were 0.876, 0.905, 0.830, 0.894, and 0.846, respectively. With TR4 as the cut-off value, the AUCs of the CAD system and the junior and senior radiologists were 0.867, 0.628, and 0.722, respectively, and the CAD system had the highest AUC (P < 0.0001).
- With TR5 as the cut off value, the AUCs of the CAD system and the junior and senior radiologists were 0.867, 0.654, and 0.812, respectively, and the CAD system had a higher AUC than the junior radiologist (P < 0.0001) but comparable to the senior radiologist (P = 0.0709).
- With the assistance of the CAD system, the number of TR4 nodules was decreased by both junior and senior radiologists, the malignant rate of punctured nodules increased by 30% and 22%, and the unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions were both reduced by nearly half.

Conclusion:

- The CAD system based on deep learning can improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists in identifying benign and malignant.
