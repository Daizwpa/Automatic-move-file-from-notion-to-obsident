- due to the complex nature of the nodules, there may be some some overlap between the features of benign and malignant nodules on complex US images. [12]. Therefore, they are not always satisfactorily distinguished by operator-dependent US. In recent years, some thyroid scoring systems have been developed (K-TIRADS, EU-TIRADS, ACR-TIRADS, ATA, BTA, etc.) to diagnose benign and malignant thyroid nodules. These scoring systems are used to score cancer
rate. According to the cancer score ratio, clinicians determine whether to perform surgical
intervention [13–15].
