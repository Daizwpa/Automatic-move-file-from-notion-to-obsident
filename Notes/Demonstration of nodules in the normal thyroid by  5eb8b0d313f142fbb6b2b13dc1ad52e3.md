- For many years ultrasonography has been used for examination of the thyroid. In addition to the estimation of the volume of the gland (Rasmussen & Hjorth, 1974), this method is of special interest for the demonstration of abnormal masses.
- **Thyroid masses can be differentiated ultrasonically into fluid-filled and solid nodules, according to their ability to reflect sound; however, further differentiation of solid nodules is of limited value** (Crocker et al, 1974; Taylor et al, 1974; Frank & Zollikofer, 1976; Thijs & Wiener, 1976; Blum et al, 1977; Frank et al, 1977)
- Since high-frequency short-focus ultrasound transducers became available, very small nodules may be demonstrated in the thyroid. These may not be detected by radionuclide scanning because of their small volume, posterior location in the lobes, or because they take up the radionuclide.
- Pinedo et al (1984) demonstrated small thyroid nodules ultrasonically, which could not be demonstrated by radionuclide scintigraphy in only 1.3% of 1586 patients who were referred for radionuclide studies of the thyroid.
- Thyroid modularity was reported in 42.7% of 1629 necropsy cases (Leyer et al, 1983).
- Thyroid nodules seemed to occur more frequently in elderly subjects, with the highest frequency in the seventh and eighth decade in men and in the seventh decade in women.
- Sonography is very useful to follow small thyroid nodules: it can disclose not only growth, but also possible regression, degeneration or cystic change. Malignant cells could not be demonstrated following aspiration-biopsy of four nodules in this series. However, no surgical proof was obtained of any of these lesions.
- **Echoic nodules cannot be differentiated further by ultrasound and the echogenicity of an adenoma may  not be different from that of a carcinoma, although a hyporeflective, poorly encapsulated nodule is more likely to represent a carcinoma.**

Conclusion:

- Using real-time ultrasound with high-frequency transducers it is often possible to demonstrate small nodules in a normal thyroid. These nodules are most often echoic. In this series the incidence varies with age, reaching the highest value (>40%) in the seventh decade
