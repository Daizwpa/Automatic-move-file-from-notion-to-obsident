list of features: GLCM entropylog10, GLCM entropylog2, GLRLM hgre, GLRLM lrhge, GLRLM relnu, GLRLM srhge, GLZLM glnu, GLZLM hgze, GLZLM szhge, GLZLM zlnu, SHAPE compacity, SUV max, SUV mean, SUV min, SUV peak, SUV std, TLG

Objective:

- The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of18F-FDG PET/CT texture analysis to predict the exact pathological outcome of thyroid incidentalomas.

Conclusion:

- In the differentiation of benign-malignant thyroid incidentalomas, GLRLMRLNU and SUVmax combination may be more useful than SUVmax to predict the outcome.
