Objective:

- The present study evaluated the ability of PET metrics and radiomics features to predict final diagnosis of [18F] FDG thyroid incidentalomas (TIs).
- 

Task:

- Collect data ( 104 patients with 107 TIs were retrospectively studied; 30 nodules (28%) were diagnosed as malignant).
- After volumetric segmentation of each thyroid lesion, Calculate metabolic tumor volume, total lesion glycolysis (TLG), standardized uptake values (SUVs), and metabolic heterogeneity were estimated, and 107 radiomics features

Results:

- Metabolic tumor volumes, TLG, SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak among functional PET parameters, and GLCM_InverseDifferenceMoment, shape_Sphericity, GLCM_SumSquares, firstorder_Maximum2DDiameterSlice, firstorder_Energy, and GLCM_Contrast among nonredundant radiomics features, showed significantly different values between malignant and benign TIs (Mann Whitney-U, P < 0.01 for all).
- Univariate logistic regression revealed these parameters demonstrated good ability to predict final diagnosis of TIs (P < 0.02 for all).
- Shape_Sphericity was the best predictor classifying 82% of TIs correctly (P < 0.0001). Only TLG, SUVmax, and shape_Sphericity retained significance (P < 0.0001) by multivariate analysis.

Conclusion:

- PET metrics and radiomics analysis can improve identification of [18F]FDG- avid TIs at high risk of malignancy. A model based on TLG, SUVmax, and shape_Sphericity may allow prediction of a final diagnosis, providing useful information for the management of TIs.
