Number Of Patient: 3353
Type of paper: Experimental article

Objective:

- To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a modified thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI Rads) in combination with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for  differentiating between benign and malignant thyroid nodules and to assess inter-observer concordance between different observers.

Task:

- Collect data of 3353 patients who underwent thyroid ultrasound and contrast-enhanced in ten center between 2018 to 2020.
- Ten radiologist analysed and classify US and CEUS  based on modified Ti-rads.
- Pathology test used to identify the ground truth and calculate the performance matrices of the modified TI Rads based on, the matrices include: ACC, SEN, SPN, PPV and NVP.

Results:

- The calculated malignancy risk in the modiﬁed TI-RADS categories 5, 4b, 4a, 3 and 2 nodules was 95.4%, 86.0%, 12.0%, 4.1% and 0%, respectively.
- The ROC curve showed that the AUC under the ROC curve was 0.936, and the cutoff value of the modiﬁed TI-RADS classiﬁcation was >TI-RADS 4a, whose SEN, ACC, PPV, NPV and SPN were 93.6%, 91.9%, 90.4%, 93.7% and 88.5% respectively.

Conclusion:

- The modiﬁed TI-RADS had high diagnostic efﬁciency for the diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. The inter-observer agreement for the modiﬁed TI-RADS category was excellent, thus suggesting that this classiﬁcation is very suitable for
clinical application.
