Quotes:

- Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for thyroid nodules, and the ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the preferred method of tissue sampling.
- Nodules one centimetre or larger, or nodules with suspicious sonographic appearance warrant cytologic analysis to better quantify the risk of malignancy.
- Molecular biomarkers are a powerful adjunct to cytology, as detecting malignancy pre-
operatively allows total thyroidectomy in a single operation without the need for frozen section or a second operation for completion thyroidectomy if malignancy is found during the initial thyroid lobectomy.
- Nodules are typically found on physical exam or incidentally when other imaging studies are
performed.
- the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is only 4 to 7%, (1,2).
- Ultrasonography is far more sensitive than palpation, as it detects nodules of any size in up to 67% of the general population (3).
- Thyroid nodules warrant removal when they are large enough to be symptomatic, or if there is a concern for malignancy.
- The majority of nodules are asymptomatic, and with only 5 to 10% of nodules being malignant, the decision to operate is made on therapeutic or diagnostic grounds (4,5).
- Ultrasound imaging studies and cytology from fine-needle aspiration are the main tools used by the clinician to decide whether surgical excision of a thyroid nodule is warranted.
- Molecular genetic biomarker analyses are now being used to increase the accuracy of fine needle aspiration biopsies, and appear to substantially alter the clinical decision-making process as they become more widely available and more thoroughly evaluated.
- Cytology and molecular biomarkers are the primary diagnostic modalities a surgeon utilizes to determine the extent of thyroid surgery.
- Important elements in the patient’s history which increase the likelihood of *Thyroid nodules* malignancy include:
    - prior head and neck irradiation (especially during childhood, with a relative risk of 8.7 at 1 Gy for x-rays and gamma-radiation),
    - reports of rapid growth,
    - dysphagia,
    - dysphonia,
    - male gender,
    - presentation at extremes of age (less than 20 years or more than 70 years),
    - a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (8,9).
- Sonographic  features that have been consistently associated with malignancyd:
    - Solid appearance (or hypoechogenicity),
    - increased vascularity,
    - microcalcifications,
    - irregular margins,
    - the absence of a halo
- There is certainly some subjectivity to these features *(sonographic features)* , and characteristics vary depending on the histology such that ultrasound alone cannot reliably distinguish malignant and benign lesions (18).
- While they do not obviate the need for biopsy, these features are extremely useful in selecting the site within a nodule for fine needle aspirate biopsy (FNAB) in order to improve diagnostic yield, or to select appropriate nodules to aspirate within a multinodular thyroid (4).
- Both of these imaging modalities *(CT and  MRI)* have almost no role in the initial evaluation of a thyroid nodule, and are rarely indicated in the initial workup. However, they are both excellent (100% sensitivities) for evaluating the extent of large substernal goiters which may be compressing nearby structures (21). Of note, iodinated contrast material utilized for CT scan should be avoided because its use prevents scintigraphy or administration of radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for a period of 1 to 2 months. Gadolinium contrast used with MRI does not interfere
with thyroid uptake of radiotracer, but it is significantly more expensive than CT or ultrasound.
