Objective:

- The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the conventional imaging modalities (CT, MRI, US) and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the detection of lymph node metastases in the neck.

Results:

- The sensitivity of conventional imaging modalities and FNAC were 82.8% and 81.8%, respectively, while specificity were 73.9% and 100%, respectively. Positive predictive value calculated for imaging modalities and FNAC were 82.8%, 100%, respectively, while negative predictive values were 73.9% and 66.6%, respectively.

Conclusion:

- Neither the sensitivity of imaging modalities (CT, MRI, US) nor FNAC reached 100%, none of these methods can definitively exclude the presence of regional tumor metastasis. According to these data, no permissive alteration should be allowed from the current guidelines (e.g. NCCN) based on imaging/FNAC examinations regarding the need for elective neck dissection.
