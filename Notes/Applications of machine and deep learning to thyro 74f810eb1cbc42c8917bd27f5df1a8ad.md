Objective:

- This review shall focus on the application of ML and DL to thyroid cancer cyto- and histopathology. Research studies were identiﬁed by searching PubMed with terms including thyroid cancer, machine learning, deep learning and artiﬁcial intelligence.

Quotes:

- Around 10% of acquired FNAs are unsatisfactory for diagnosis (TBS1) due to parameters like
obscuring blood, poor cell preservation, and insufﬁcient cell sampling (15, 16), with the recommendation to repeat the biopsy with ultrasound guidance.
- some malignancies cytological diagnosis is challenging (17–20), resulting in both high interobserver variability (21, 22) and an estimated 15–30% returning an indeterminate result (TBS3 or 4) (11, 16)
- Current issues with thyroid FNA biopsies – including high interobserver variability (21, 22), a signiﬁcant proportion returning indeterminate samples (11, 16), and the fact that some pathologies cannot be reliably classiﬁed using cytological criteria (76) – necessitate such improvements

- Thyroid cancer type:
    - Papillary (PTC),
    - Follicular (FTC),
    - Anaplastic (ATC)
    - Medullary (MTC)
- Additionally subtype/variants:
    - Follicular  variants of PTC.
    - Tall cell variants of PTC.
- An additional diagnosis of particular note is that of ‘noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features’ (NIFTPs). This term was introduced in 2016 to replace the noninvasive encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (EFV-PTC): despite NIFTPs having cells
resembling those of PTC, they have low malignant potential, and effectively distinguishing between NIFTPs and classic PTC can aid in therapy de-escalation (3, 7, 8).
- Benign nodules are usually represented by:
    - non-neoplastic (multinodular hyperplasia/goitre, cysts)
    - neoplastic [follicular adenoma (FA)] lesions.
