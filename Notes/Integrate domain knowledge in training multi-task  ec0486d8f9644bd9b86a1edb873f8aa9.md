- Thyroid nodules are common clinical diseases. According to epidemiological data, the incidence of thyroid nodules in the population is 19%–68%, of which about 5%–15% are malignant (Liu et al., 2019).
- Clinical diagnosis of thyroid nodules requires experienced radiologists to read the ultrasound (US) B-mode and ultrasound elastography image slices and then give the diagnostic result.
