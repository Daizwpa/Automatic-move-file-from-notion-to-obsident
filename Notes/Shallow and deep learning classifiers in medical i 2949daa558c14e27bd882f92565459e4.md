Objective:

- This review aims to give primary educational insights on the most accessible and widely employed classifiers in radiology field, distinguishing between “shallow” learning (i.e., traditional machine learning) algorithms, including support vector machines, random forest and XGBoost, and “deep” learning architectures including convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. In addition, the paper outlines the key steps for classifiers training and highlights the differences between the most common algorithms and architectures.
