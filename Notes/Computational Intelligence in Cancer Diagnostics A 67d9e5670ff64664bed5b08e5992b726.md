Quotes:

- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as reported in Feb 2022, the
most common cause of mortality in the world is cancer, causing nearly 10 million deaths in
2020: one in six deaths from all causes.

Futures direction:

- Explainable AI.
- Generative AI.
- Internet of Everything.
- Big data and augmented analytic.
- Cloud, Edge and Fog Computing.
- Robots and machine co-creativity.
- Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Virtual Reality (VR).

Open Challenges:

- Lack of divers and large datasets.
- Developing personalized models:
    - As can be clearly interpreted from [99], mammographic breast-cancer-diagnosis models frequently assume that patientsâ€™ presenting characteristics are distributed in the same way. However, different patients might have one-of-a-kind characteristics that are not taken into account by the model. It may be possible to improve the accuracy of mammographic breast cancer diagnosis by developing new methods for the creation of personalized models that can take into account the unique characteristics of each individual patient.
- interpreting the hybrid approach.
- addressing ethical consideration.
- Clinical challenges.
