Objective:

- In this review, we summarise data from published literature on the effect of chromosomal instability and genetic mutations on cancer cell migration and invasion.

Quotes:

- Several different parameters in the tumour microenvironment inÔ¨Çuence the regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion:
    - The presence of hypoxia
    - Chemoattractants
    - extracellular matrix stiffness.
    - lack of nutrients prompt cancer cells to start searching for a ‚Äòbetter life‚Äô
- Genome instability and mutations determine the hallmarks of cancer, one of which is the ability of tumour cells to invade and metastasise.1
- Metastasis is the leading cause of death from cancer. During the process of metastasis, tumour cells leave the primary site and spread throughout the body, forming secondary sites and causing severe organ failure.2
- The Ô¨Årst step of the metastatic cascade is invasion, in which tumour cells penetrate their surrounding basement membrane and migrate through the extracellular matrix (ECM) into the surrounding tissue (Fig. 1).3

- **CHROMOSOMAL INSTABILITY  includes changes in the number of  chromosomes     as well as their rearrangement, is observed in many tumour types and is associated with tumour progression.**
- Chromosomal instability can be distinguished into Numerical Chromosomal Instability or Structural chromosomal instability. In both of them loss of heterozygosity can arise.

- Loss of heterozygosity deÔ¨Åned as the loss of one allele caused by deletion, mitotic recombination, gene conversion or loss of a chromosome
- Loss of heterozygosity is a common alteration in cancer; it results in haploinsufÔ¨Åciency or loss of gene expression, and frequently affects tumour-suppressor genes, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis.
