- PTC is prone to early regional lymph node metastasis. Previous studies have reported that the rate of lymph node metastasis in patients with PTC ranges from 30%–80%
- Central lymph nodes (CLN) serve as the primary site for lymph node metastasis of PTC. Within the CLN, the Delphian lymph nodes (DLN) play a crucial role and have the ability to predict the further development of thyroid cancer.
- When Raymond B. Randall was an intern at Massachusetts General Hospital, he found that DLN nodules could predict the clinical progression of head and neck malignancies, similar to Delphi the prophet, a priestess of the Temple of Apollo, known for predicting the future (6).
- lymphatic imaging using the US is a preoperative technique to determine CLN metastases, which can avoid excessive lymph node dissection compared with the intraoperative application of lymph node contrast agent (4);
- Due to the concealed anatomical site of DLN, preoperative US examination is challenging. Hence, pathological evaluations are performed to determine the presence of DLN metastasis (5).
- Central lymph nodes (CLN) serve as the primary site for lymph node metastasis of PTC. **Within the CLN, the Delphian lymph nodes (DLN) play a crucial role and have the ability to predict the further development of thyroid cancer.**
- DLN is often easily intraoperatively overlooked by the operator. Therefore, it is not routinely utilized as a central group clearance area.
- Ultrasound (US) is the primary method for preoperative diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in thyroid cancer; however, its accuracy in determining central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is only approximately 10%–63%. US is limited due to its subjectivity and is related to the standard of the operator, contributing to considerable differences in the study results across different institutions (7). Due to the concealed anatomical site of DLN, preoperative US examination is challenging. Hence, pathological evaluations are performed to determine the presence of DLN metastasis (5).
- **Furthermore, lymphatic imaging using the US is a preoperative technique to determine CLN metastases, which can avoid excessive lymph node dissection compared with the intraoperative application of lymph node contrast agent (4); however, the value of its application warrants further investigation.**
- The postoperative recurrence of patients with PTC has been prevalently reported (8). The presence of lymph node metastasis is strongly associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with PTC (9, 10).
