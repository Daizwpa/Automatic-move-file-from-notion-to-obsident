# Breast, prostate, and thyroid cancer screening tests and overdiagnosis

Date published: 01/02/2017
Key word: Cancer screening, Overdiagnosis, Overtreatment
Status: Not started
Task: Over-diagnosis
Type of paper: review paper

Objective:

- The purpose of this study was to examine overdiagnosis and overtreatment related to cancer screening and to review relevant reports and studies

Method:

- A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and gray literature was conducted for relevant studies published between January 2000 and December 2015 reporting **breast**, **prostate**, and **thyroid** cancer screening tests and overdiagnosis.

Results:

- This study revealed no dichotomy on where screening would lower risk or cause overdiagnosis and overtreatment.
- 

Conclusion:

Quotes:

- Recommending medical services to patients without symptoms and currently experiencing no inconvenience may constitute overtreatment.

⚠️

- The problem (does the screening test help or hinder the patient?) :
    - if the benefits provided by screening tests are not clearly greater than the tangible and intangible costs associated with the screening tests, continued use of that screening test should be reconsidered. However, it is difficult for patients and physicians to make such a decision when there is belief that state-of-the-art medical technologies can make everything possible. Up to date, reports that systematically review the efficacy of screening tests are rare.

- An additional problem is that current screening tests cannot distinguish the progression rates of heterogeneous cancers in an individual patient.
- Currently, it is only possible to estimate the presence or absence of an overdiagnosis by comparing cancer detection rates and mortality rates within specific periods and population types.18,19
- Consequently, the purpose of current cancer screening test programs should not be to detect more cancers, but rather to detect fatal cancers.
- Some subjects may benefit from overdiagnosis. However, when the trade-off effect between benefits and risks for an entire population is examined, only a small number of patients can benefit from overdiagnosis.
- There are many instances of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis. Although approximately 1600 people in the United States die of thyroid cancer each year, the number diagnosed with thyroid cancer is approximately 37,000, more than 20 times of the number of deaths.40
- However, data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program indicate that thyroid cancer mortality rates in the United States are stable, **indicating that a considerable number of patients have been overdiagnosed and overtreated related to thyroid cancer**
- South Korea has received international attention because its thyroid cancer incidence rate is increased more than 10-fold in the past decade.42,43
- However, follow-up data indicate that the relative survival rate is 99.2% over the past 10 years.19 These data indicate that thyroid ultrasound screening tests might have been performed excessively and unnecessarily, thus leading to overtreatments such as thyroidectomy.
- In cancer screening, increased incidence of overdiagnosis is related to the rapid development and improvement in radiological technology.

⚠️

- Thyroid surgery can result in damage to:
    - List dangers:
        - laryngeal nerves
        - weakened voice
        - calcium metabolism disorders due to hypofunction of the parathyroid glands.

Such surgery is followed by a lifelong ingestion of hormone drugs.46  

Based on such risks, it is unnecessary to recommend thyroid cancer screening to asymptomatic people.

### Incidentalomas:

- During diagnosis, radiologists often discover abnormal nodules unrelated to the problem that they were investigating. Such nodules are referred to as incidentalomas.
- it is better to disregard such incidentalomas as the benefits of further diagnosis and treatment are unclear.49
- It has been reported that the probability of death during further incidentaloma-related inspection is similar to that of death resulting from a fatal incidentaloma.16,50
- It is desirable to restrict further investigation of an incidentaloma to observation of its growth progress because there is a strong likelihood of overdiagnosis or overtreatment when patients are healthy without exhibiting symptoms or when there are insufficient indications of benefits arising from preventive treatment.52

Myth about screening test:

- lead-time:
    - **the illusion that even when screening does not help reduce mortality rates after it has detected cancer, screening still is seen as advantageous as it extends the survival time of patients with cancer (Fig 1).**
- length-time:
