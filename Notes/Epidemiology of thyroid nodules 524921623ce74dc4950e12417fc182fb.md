- The prevalence of nodular thyroid disease has increased over time predominantly due to advances in imaging techniques.
- Iodine, a key component of thyroid hormone production, is known to effect thyroid function. It is estimated that around 30% of the world’s population is deficient in iodine intake which can lead to goiter/nodule formation [1–3].
- Prior to the introduction of iodine, the prevalence of thyroid nodules >1 cm increased with age from 15% in wo me n aged 40–45, to 25–30% in those aged 60–65 [9].
- In a survey of 1411 subjects in Pescopagano, an iodine-deficient village in Southern Italy, goiter prevalence was 16% in children and 59.8% in adults [11]. Dietary iodinated salt incorporation decreased the overall prevalence of goiter from 46%, in 1995, to 26%, in 2010 (P < 0.0001) [12]. Similar changes were noted in an iodine deficient region of China where schoolchildren aged 8–10 years showed a reduction in goiter prevalence pre- and post-normalization of iodine levels from 18% to 9%, respectively [13].
- Eleven years after initiation of the iodization requirement, the DanThyr study showed that among the 618 subjects with thyroid nodules at baseline, 24% had no evidence of nodules in follow-up [10] indicating reversal of nodular disease with normalization of iodine levels.
- Iodine repletion leading to the correction of thyroid disorders has been consistent in other studies [14–16]. This change is not permanent though; if iodized salts are removed from the diet and iodine levels become once again insufficient, goiter prevalence rapidly returns to pre-iodization levels [17].
- Radiation exposure, thyroid nodularity, and cancer risk are correlated. Antonelli et al. in Pisa, Italy, evaluated 50 male medical workers occupationally exposed to radiation and compared them to nonexposed workers. Thyroid nodules were detected in 38% of exposed workers compared to 13% of those unexposed, living in the same area [18].
- When comparing the accuracy of thyroid ultrasound to post mortem pathological review, ultrasound has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 84% [62]. High resolution ultrasound (US) machines are able to detect impalpable nodules as small as 1–3 mm in size [63].
- The prevalence of thyroid nodules appear to be similar in different areas around the world [70–72] with iodine status remaining as the main determining factor of prevalence differences [4–6].
- **The prevalence rate is 67% with ultrasonography (US) imaging, 15% with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck, and 1–2% with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography.**
- In the absence of a history of external beam radiation or familial medullary thyroid cancer, the risk of malignancy ranges between 5 and 13% when discovered with US, CT or MRI, **but is much higher if based on focal FDG uptake (30%).**
- The reported sensitivity ranges from 87 to 95% for the detection of carcinomas and the negative predictive value from 88 to 99.8%.

Summary:

- Thyroid nodules are common in clinical practice. Prior to the use of high-resolution ultrasound, thyroid nodules were identified by palpation in 4–7% of the population. While the incidence via palpation has not changed significantly over the decades, the use of sensitive ultrasound machines has increased the nodular disease prevalence to 50–70% in the general population.
- The prevalence of nodular disease and goiters also differs depending on the population screened. For instance, there is a higher incidence of thyroid nodules in areas of low iodine intake, especially in smokers compared to those living in iodine sufficient societies. Those who consume alcohol tend to have a lower incidence of thyroid nodularity. Thus, environment and medical history should be taken into account when evaluating a patient with an incidental thyroid nodule to avoid over aggressiveness in nodular management when only iodine supplementation may be required initially.
