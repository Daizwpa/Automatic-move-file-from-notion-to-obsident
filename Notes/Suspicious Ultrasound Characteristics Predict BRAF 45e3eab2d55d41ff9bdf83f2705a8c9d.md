Type of paper: review paper

Objective:

- In this study, we examined a series of PTC ‚â•1 cm to determine whether speciÔ¨Åc US characteristics can reliably predict the BRAFV600E mutation as well as detect the more aggressive variants of PTC that are usually associated with the BRAFV600E mutation.
- The aim of this blinded cohort study was to determine whether these speciÔ¨Åc Ultrasound characteristics can also reliably detect the more aggressive variants of PTC that are often associated with the BRAFV600E mutation.

Problematic:

- BRAFV600E mutation is a somatic alteration that results in oncogenic activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and has been associated with PTC that has aggressive histopathologic features such as ETT and lymph node metastasis (LNM) (11‚Äì13). **Preoperative detection of BRAFV600E** on FNA specimens can potentially alter the initial operative approach (13‚Äì15).

Task:

- 106 patients who met inclusion criteria were further studied, among whom 55 patients had BRAF-positive PTC and 51 patients had BRAF-negative PTC.

- BRAF-positivity was associated with most known suspicious US Ô¨Åndings, including
    - taller-than-wide shape (47% vs. 7%, p < 0.001),
    - ill-deÔ¨Åned margins (42% vs. 9%, p < 0.001),
    - hypoechogenicity (83% vs. 36%, p < 0.001),
    - micro/macrocalciÔ¨Åcations (87% vs. 24%, p < 0.001),
    - absent halo (85% vs. 27%, p < 0.001)
    
    but was not associated with noncystic composition.

- When ‚â• 3 suspicious US features were present, BRAF-positivity was predicted with a positive predictive value of 82%.
- The absence of suspicious US features together with negative BRAF testing predicted PTC without extrathyroidal extension or lymph node metastasis (negative predictive value 88%).

Conclusion:

- With routine preoperative cervical US and molecular testing, a trained radiologist or surgeon can improve the preoperative characterization of PTC, potentially impacting risk stratiÔ¨Åcation and initial surgical management.

Quote:

- US has been a valuable tool in characterizing and diagnosing thyroid pathology for over Ô¨Åfty years.
- Initially, crude US images were only able to differentiate cystic from solid lesions, but the Ô¨Åeld has undergone rapid technological evolution and now includes color Doppler, B-mode imaging, three-dimensional imaging, and elastography, allowing physicians to provide a much more detailed assessment.
- Improved discrimination between benign and malignant nodules can help determine which nodules should undergo Ô¨Åne-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA), and numerous malignant
sonographic features have been described, including micro-calciÔ¨Åcations, hypoechogenicity, an irregular margin, loss of the halo, non-cystic composition, intratumoral hypervascu-larity, and taller-than-wide shape (5‚Äì8).
- The small size was likely a signiÔ¨Åcant confounding factor in accurately characterizing these lesions by preoperative US.
- Cervical US is an accurate and non-invasive modality for thyroid nodule characterization, and there are a number of US characteristics that have been associated with malignancy (5‚Äì9).
- The presence of these features can help determine which nodules are to be evaluated further with FNA and in the 2009 ATA Management Guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer, the presence of these suspicious US characteristics should prompt FNA in nodules that are as small as 5mm (3).
- We and others believe that preoperative US is an excellent noninvasive method of staging and should be routinely performed, but there is great interest in identifying other preoperative features that are predictive of aggressive PTC which may prompt more extensive initial surgery, such as central compartment lymph node dissection.
- In a large, multicenter, and retrospective study of thyroid nodule US   et al. (9) reported that several of these features predict thyroid malignancy with varying sensitivity and speciÔ¨Åcity.
- Extrathyroidal extension (ETT) and invasion into surrounding structures can sometimes be assessed, although with low sensitivity. BRAFV600E mutation is a somatic alteration that results in oncogenic activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and has been associated with PTC that has aggressive histopathologic features such as ETT and lymph node metastasis (LNM) (11‚Äì13). Preoperative detection of BRAFV600E on FNA specimens can potentially alter the initial operative approach (13‚Äì15).

    - Kwak et al. (16) reported a correlation between BRAFV600E and small tumor size, high TNM stage, and extracapsular invasion, but found no signiÔ¨Åcant correlation between suspicious US features and BRAF positivity.
    - Hwang et al. (17) also demonstrated no signiÔ¨Åcant associations between BRAF status and suspicious US features. However, both these studies predominantly evaluated small papillary thyroid micro-
    carcinomas, with mean tumor sizes of 6 and 9mm, respectively. The small size was likely a signiÔ¨Åcant confounding factor in accurately characterizing these lesions by preoperative US.
