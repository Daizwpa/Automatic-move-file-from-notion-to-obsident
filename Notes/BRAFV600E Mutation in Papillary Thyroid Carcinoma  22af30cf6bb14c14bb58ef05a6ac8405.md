Objective:

- The aim of the present study was to establish the prevalence of this genetic alteration and to define association of BRAFV600E mutation with clinico-pathological characteristics of PTC in Indian subcontinental population.

Task:

- 

Results:

- We found significant correlation between BRAF mutation status and extra-thyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor stage. However no correlation was observed with gender, age, and tumor size of the patients.

Conclusion:

- Our findings suggest that BRAFV600E is a prevalent genetic alteration in adult sporadic PTCs in Indian cohort and it may be responsible for the progression of classic variant of PTC to metastatic and poorly differentiated subtype and likely to have significant impact on its diagnostic and prognostic management.

Quotes:

- Thyroid cancer has a wide range of biological and clinical behavior ranging from very indolent well-differentiated carcinoma to highly aggressive poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinoma [1]
- The somatic point mutation of BRAF which occurs commonly in a broad range of human cancers, most notably in melanoma, **is due to the thymine to adenine transversion at nucleotide position 1799 of BRAF gene, resulting in a valine to glutamic acid substitution at residue 600 (BRAFV600E) [8].**
- The BRAF mutation found in thyroid cancer is almost exclusively T1799A transversion mutation in exon 15. It can now be detected pre-operatively on FNAB specimens and has been proposed to have potential as a diagnostic adjunctive tool in evaluation of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytological findings [11–13] as well as a prognostic marker to improve risk evaluation and recurrence prediction [14–16].
- It is known that different geographic areas and genetic background among races may contribute to difference in frequency and type of mutations as well as their role in the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer [5, 8].
