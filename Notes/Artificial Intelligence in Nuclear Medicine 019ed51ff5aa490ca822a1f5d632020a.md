Objective:

- In this review, we provide a conceptual classification and a brief summary of the technical fundamentals of AI.
- 

Quotes:

- Radiomics is currently being evaluated in a multitude of small, often retrospective studies, which often try to predict information such as histologic subtype, mutational status, or a response to a certain therapy from medical images of tumors.
- there are already some attempts to replace the 2-step process (1:convert image to high-dimensional vector,  2:classifier ) in radiomics with deep learning by placing the image data directly into the input layer of an ANN without prior feature extraction.
