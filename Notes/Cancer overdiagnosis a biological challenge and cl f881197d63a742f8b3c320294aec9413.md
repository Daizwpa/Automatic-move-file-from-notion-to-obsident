- The goal of cancer screening is to detect either a preneoplastic lesion or a cancer at an early stage where treatment will change the outcome and prolong survival.
- Overdiagnosis is generally defined as the diagnosis of disease that would never cause symptoms or death during a given patientâ€™s lifetime.
- Overdiagnosis is distinct from misdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is primarily driven by screening asymptomatic patients. Screening can detect not only asymptomatic cancers that are destined to cause harm but also indolent or benign forms of the disease that will never harm the patient (Fig. 1).
- Overdiagnosis occurs either when the detected cancer is never going to progress and cause symptoms or when the cancer will not progress rapidly enough to cause symptoms in a person with limited life expectancy.
- In fact, most available screening tests are better at detecting slow- growing tumours than detecting rapidly progressing ones, a phenomenon known as length- biased sampling (Fig. 2).
- A major potential harm of screening is overdiagnosis.
- For cancer screening to be successful, it should primarily detect cancers with lethal potential or their precursors early , leading to therapy that reduces mortality and morbidity.
- Screening programmes have been successful for colon and cervical cancers, where subsequent surgical removal of precursor lesions has resulted in a reduction in cancer incidence and mortality.
- Since the implementation of screening tests for certain cancers (for example, breast and prostate cancers), a spike in incidence of in situ and early-stage cancers has been observed, but a link to reduction in cancer- specific mortality has not been as clear.
- It is difficult to determine how many of these mortality reductions are due to screening and how many are due to improved treatments of tumours.

- More sensitive screening methods are detecting smaller and smaller lesions, but this has not been accompanied by a comparable reduction in the incidence of invasive cancers.

- The goal of cancer screening is to detect either a preneoplastic lesion or a cancer at an early stage where treatment will change the outcome and prolong survival.

- While colonoscopy is a relatively safe procedure, there are adverse events, including approximately 4 perforations and 8 instances of major bleeding per 10,000 colonoscopies7.
- Overdiagnosis occurs either when the detected cancer is never going to progress and cause symptoms or when the cancer will not progress rapidly enough to cause symptoms in a person with limited life expectancy.

ðŸ”¥ Using these criteria and the amalgamation of several studies, it can be estimated that approximately:

- 25% of breast cancers detected by mammography,
- 50% of lung cancers detected by chest radiography and/or sputum examination,
- 13â€“25% of lung cancers detected by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT),
- 50â€“60% of prostate cancers detected by prostate- specific antigen (PSA)

 are overdiagnosed. 8,9,14
