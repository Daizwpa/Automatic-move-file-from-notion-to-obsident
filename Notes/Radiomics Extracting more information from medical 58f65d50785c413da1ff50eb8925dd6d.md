- Solid cancers are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. This limits the use of invasive biopsy based molecular assays but gives huge potential for medical imaging, which has the ability to capture      intratumoural heterogeneity in a non-invasive way.
- During the past decades, medical imaging innovations with new hardware, new imaging agents and standardised protocols, allows
the field to move towards quantitative imaging. Therefore, also the development of automated and reproducible analysis methodologies to extract more information from image-based features is a requirement. Radiomics – the high-throughput extraction of large amounts of image features from radiographic images – addresses this problem and is one of the approaches that hold great promises but need further validation in multi-centric settings and in the laboratory.
- The use and role of medical imaging technologies in clinical oncology has greatly expanded from primarily a diagnostic tool to include a more central role in the context of individualised medicine over the past decade (Fig. 1)
