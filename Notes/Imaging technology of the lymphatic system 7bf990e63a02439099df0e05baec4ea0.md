- Definition of lymphatic system:
    - After the blood circulation, the lymphatic system is the second vascular system in mammalian species. It fulﬁls vital functions such as the maintenance of tissue ﬂuid homeostasis,
    - the initiation of immune responses via the drainage of antigens and cells and the uptake of dietary lipids in the intestine.
    - Present in most organs of the body, with the notable exceptions of the brain and bone marrow,
    - the lymphatic system is composed of blind-ended lymphatic capillaries responsible for the uptake of interstitial ﬂuid and proteins and downstream collecting lymphatic vessels that actively transport lymph ﬂuid through a series of lymph nodes to the blood circulation [1].
