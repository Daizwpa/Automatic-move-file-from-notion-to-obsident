Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with increasing incidence rates, but with stable lower mortality rates.

Objective:

In this comprehensive review we provide the evidence  AI applications in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer and discuss its future.

Abstract:

- The diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer is fraught with challenges.
- Artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing a paradigm shift to the healthcare, powered by quick advancement of the analytic techniques.
- Several recent studies have shown remarkable progress in thyroid cancer diagnostics based on AI-assisted algorithms.
- Limited clinical experience and lack of prospective validation studies remain the biggest drawbacks.
- Application of AI techniques in thyroid ultrasonography and cytopathology have shown remarkable improvement in sensitivity and specificity over the traditional diagnostic modalities.

Introduction:

- The main concern is the potential for malignancy, even though only around 5% of cases turn out to be malignant[1]
- the exponential increase in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer is primarily due to the increased adoption of diagnostic imaging technology and medical surveillance together with improved access to general health care[2].
- Thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is associated with significant intra-observer and inter-observer variability. Its sensitivity ranges from 68% to 98% while the specificity ranges from 56% to 100%.
- Nearly 15% to 30% of thyroid nodules are categorised as indeterminate in thyroid FNAC, of which 25% are later found to be malignant[5].
- The indeterminate thyroid nodules should have received The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) category III, IV, or V in thyroid FNAC is shown in Table 1[6,
- surgery for indeterminate nodules carries a risk of surgical complications and associated costs, both of which can be avoided, if we could confidently identify the likelihood of thyroid cancer in indeterminate nodules.
- Molecular testing with next generation sequencing technology that looks for a wide range of genomic alterations in the thyroid FNAC samples in patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules can help to resolve diagnostic uncertainties[8].
- The ability of machines to approach problem-solving with human-like logic is known as artificial intelligence (AI).
- The main limitation of the DL method is the need for large datasets for training the model. Another limitation is the difficulty to understand how the AI arrived at its decision (black-box issue) due to lack of explanations. This creates new challenges for safety, trust and reliability.
- Radiomics is another application of AI which is gaining importance.
- radiomics workflow include image acquisition, image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection (i.e., elimination of unreliable, uninformative or redundant features), and construction of classification and prediction models.
- Radiomics is described as the extraction of high-throughput features from medical images, deeper data mining of the image information using automatic or semiautomatic analytical methods, and association of the extracted features with other clinical data for the purpose of supporting clinical diagnostic and treatment decisions based on the best available scientific evidence[13,14].
- The image segmentation can either be done manually (which is the gold standard) or using semi-automatic methods. Evaluation by multiple clinicians or the use of multiple algorithms can be used to avoid possible inter-observer bias.
- The features extracted can be divided into shape features (morphological features), first-order features (distribution of grayscale intensity), second-order features (texture features - heterogeneity within tumour), and higher-order features (repeating patterns, histogram-oriented patterns, or local binary patterns)[13].
- However, the limitations of radiomics include lack of data images from multiple centres and different equipment for training the AI developed predictive models and for external validation. These are needed to avoid overfitting
- AI is bringing a paradigm shift to healthcare, powered by quick advancement of analytic techniques. Several recent studies have shown remarkable progress in thyroid cancer diagnostics based on AI assisted algorithms.

APPLICATION OF AI IN THYROID ULTRASOUND:

- Some of these include the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi system, American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS), the
American Thyroid Association risk stratification system, European Thyroid Association Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System, the Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System endorsed by the Korean Thyroid Association and the Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology, Chinese Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (CTIRADS), and the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System developed by Kim et al[15] (KwakTIRADS).
- A systematic review and network meta-analysis by Kim et al[15] which compared the diagnostic performance of six of the above risk stratification systems (except C-TIRADS) observed that ACR TI-RADS had the highest diagnostic performance for the detection of thyroid nodules on ultrasound.
- A retrospective study by Yang et al[16] compared the diagnostic performance of six of these risk stratification systems (except Kwak TIRADS) **vs an AI system** (AI-SONICTM) in differentiating thyroid nodules, especially medullary thyroid carcinoma.
- The study observed that when assessing medullary thyroid carcinoma, the ACR- TI RADS had the best sensitivity (90.2%), and negative predictive value (NPV) 91.8%, and AI-SONICTM had the best specificity (85.6%) and positive predictive value (PPV) 67.5%.
- The diagnostic error rates of the AI system, junior and senior radiologists were higher for nodules with a maximum diameter of ≤ 1 cm compared to those with a maximum diameter of ≥ 1 cm.
- Zhu et al[28] developed and trained a CNN model called the Brief Efficient Thyroid Network (BETNET) using 16401 US images for localization and automatic diagnosis of thyroid nodules on US images. **The BETNET model exhibited better diagnostic performance than three state-of-the-art algorithms, which in turn has a similar diagnostic performance as the experienced radiologists.**

ROLE OF AI IN THYROID FNAC AND HISTOPATHOLOGY:

- The widespread application of ancillary techniques such as liquid-based cytology, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry has increased the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)[31-33].
- The assessment of thyroid FNAC specimens may be improved further with the AI incorporating machine learning.

ROLE OF AI IN RISK STRATIFICATION OF INDETERMINATE THYROID NODULES:

- Nodules that have a TBSRTC classification of III, IV, or V following a first evaluation (history, physical examination, ultrasound, and FNAC) are usually referred to as indeterminate thyroid nodules. **Up to 40% of all FNACs fall into the uncertain group, which has a malignancy risk between 5% and 75%.**
- 

ROLE OF AI IN PREDICTING METASTASIS IN THYROID CANCER:

- A clinical algorithm that can determine metastasis before surgery is the need of the hour.
- The clinico-pathological data including higher ACR TI-RADS score, higher number of
tumours, absence of well-defined margin, unclear junction of the lymph node, skin and marrow, presence of rim calcification on US, male sex, young age, large tumour size, and presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis predict PTCs with central lymph node metastasis than without metastasis.

ROLE OF AI IN PROGNOSTICATION OF THYROID CANCER:

- The American Joint Committee on Cancer updated the 8th TNM staging system to better predict the disease-specific survival of PTC patients. However, **it has limitations in predicting the likelihood of recurrence and does not consider the biological behaviour of PTC[58].**
- Survival prediction is important for both patients and physicians so that they can choose the best management plan.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

- The high repeatability and straightforward implementation of AI in thyroid cancer suggests that it offers significant promise in clinical application, even though there are still many obstacles to overcome before it is extensively employed in clinical practice.
- Limited clinical experience and lack of prospective validation studies remain the biggest drawbacks with another drawback being the issue regarding the legal responsibility following incorrect diagnosis using AI-based systems.
- In ideal world, the trained model should be tested in cross-validation or on an external, independent dataset before being applied on the new dataset
