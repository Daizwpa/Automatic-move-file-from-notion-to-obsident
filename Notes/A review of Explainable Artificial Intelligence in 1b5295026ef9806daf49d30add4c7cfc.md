- **AI explainability solutions based on post-hoc modelling**, and analysis for ML deciphering can be divided into:
    - Model agnostic: sensitivity analysis,
    - model specific methods.

- Sensitivity analysis can be applied globally or locally [9]:
    - Local Sensitivity Analysis (SA) methods focus on the specific impact of minor modifications in input values, assessing how these small changes influence the output of the model.
    - Global Sensitivity Analysis  (SA) techniques adopt a broader approach. They evaluate the model‚Äôs response by altering the entire spectrum of potential input values, providing a comprehensive view of how different input scenarios affect the output.
    
    This distinction between local and global methods is critical for understanding the varying degrees of influence that input parameters can have on the model‚Äôs decision- making process [10].

Quote:

- **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) encompasses the strategies and methodologies used in constructing AI systems that enable end-users to comprehend and interpret the outputs and predictions made by AI models.**
- Interpretability is about providing human-understandable rules that govern a system‚Äôs decision-making process
- explainability pertains to crafting an interface that makes the inner workings of AI decision-making accessible and comprehensible to humans.
