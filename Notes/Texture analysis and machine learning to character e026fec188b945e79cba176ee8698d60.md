Objective:

- The aim of this review is to summarize the available literature data on texture analysis, with and without CAD, in patients with suspected thyroid nodules or diﬀerentiated thyroid cancer, and to assess the current state of the approach.

Quotes:

- Imaging techniques such as scintigraphy, ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MRI) are currently used to evaluate thyroid nodules but they cannot reliably differentiate benign from malignant lesions.
- **Texture analysis allows quantitative measurement of thyroid echogenicity** (e.g., the median gray ratio) and **echotexture** (e.g., coeﬃcient of variation of gray-level histogram), using a dimensional features and avoiding the need for ﬁxed US operating conditions (such as depth and gain) [18].
- More recently, texture analysis has also been applied to other imaging modalities, such as elastosonography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and MRI, to evaluate the risk of malignancy of thyroid nodules or diﬀerentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

Conclusion:

- The possibility of extracting an “imaging biopsy” using texture analysis and machine and deep learning approaches is one of the most promising and challenging ﬁelds of modern diagnostic imaging.
- Application of texture analysis and machine learning approaches to medical imaging may be extremely useful in better characterizing thyroid nodules and in identifying those nodules or tumors with aggressive behavior; however, some methodological issues need to be solved in order to standardize and validate these approaches, making them reliable in clinical practice.
