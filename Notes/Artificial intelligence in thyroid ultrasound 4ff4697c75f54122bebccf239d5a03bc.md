Objective:

This article aims to provide a comprehensive review by discussing the fundamental theoretical knowledge of AI, including traditional ML and DL algorithms, and their clinical application in ultrasonic imaging of thyroid diseases, such as thyroid disease detection, thyroid segmentation, and differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Finally, this article addresses the challenges and prospects of AI in the clinical application of thyroid ultrasound.

Note :

AI, a branch of computer science that encompasses both machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning (DL) algorithms, is gaining increasingly popularity in the ﬁeld of medicine.

Traditional ML algorithms typically rely on the pre-deﬁned engineered features that accurately describe the regular patterns inherent in data extracted from regions of interest (ROI)  with explicit parameters on the basis of expert knowledge.

Unlike traditional ML algorithms, DL algorithms do not require predetermined features and regions of interest set by humans. Instead, they can automatically learn representations of information and gain experience from raw data (17).
