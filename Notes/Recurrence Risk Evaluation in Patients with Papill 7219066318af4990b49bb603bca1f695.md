Objective:

This study aimed **to redeﬁne LN-related risk categories by determining the optimal cut-off values of LN-related variables for RFS rates** and **to analyse clinicopathological risk factors for structural recurrence in PTC patients with pathological N1 (pN1) who underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) and neck dissection followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) remnant ablation.**

Problematic:

**central compartment LN metastases are prevalent in patients with PTC**, **most international guidelines do not recommend a prophylactic central compartment node dissection (CCND) [1,19,20]**. Therefore, the studies
identifying detailed LN-related risk factors, particularly for low- and intermediate-risk categories, must have been only from institutions where prophylactic CCND was preferred and might have been limited. Most management and follow-up strategies in patients with PTC are based on individualized estimates of the risk of structural recurrence or RFS rates. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the evidence for the use of existing LN-related risk factors
and validate their generalizability.

Task:

**proposes novel LN-related risk categories with optimal cut-off values for each detailed LN variable selected by the K-means clustering algorithm**

Introduction:

Various clinicopathological variables are associated with structural recurrence, recurrence-free survival (RFS), or disease-speciﬁc survival (DSS), and are used in international guidelines and staging or scoring systems to stratify the risk of structural recurrence [1,3–17].

Lymph node (LN) metastasis and LN-related variables, such as the number or ratio of metastatic LNs (MLNs), maximal diameter of metastatic LN foci, and extranodal extension, have been investigated as risk factors for target outcomes [1,3–18].

Therefore, it is crucial to examine the evidence for the use of existing LN-related risk factors and validate their generalizability.

Result:

In PTC patients with N1 classiﬁcation, we propose novel LN-related risk categories, which could be used to predict long-term outcomes and design targeted postoperative management and follow-up strategies for thyroidectomy patients with N1 PTC. After additional validation studies based on independent datasets, this novel LN-related risk
stratiﬁcation system might be taken into consideration when risk stratiﬁcation or staging systems are redeﬁned.
