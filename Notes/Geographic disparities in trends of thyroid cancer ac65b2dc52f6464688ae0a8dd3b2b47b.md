Objective:

- We aimed to comprehensively quantify
current trends and future projections of TC incidence and
mortality, and to explore the association between the TC bur-
den and socioeconomic inequality in different income strata.

- Method:
    - obtaining incidence and mortality data on TC and population from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and the United Nations’ World Population Prospects 2022.
    - applying an age-period-cohort (APC) model to estimate the overall annual percentage change (net drift) and age, period, and cohort effects from 1990 to 2019.
    - constructing a Bayesian APC model to predict the TC burden through 2030.
