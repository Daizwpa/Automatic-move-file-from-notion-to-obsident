Objective:

- Develop One-dimensional CNN Model to diagnosis  ischemic strokes.
- 

Problematic:

- At the same time, high-throughput technology has paved the way for big data science in the field of biology. The combination of omics datasets with machine learning techniques is an important step towards precision medicine. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been widely used for the classification of biomedical data with extensive applications in imaging data, but their applicability in omics datasets is limited

Task:

- we proposed an omics classification pipeline based on 1D CNN
- used dimensionality reduction methods to alleviate the high dimensionality issue of omics data and clustering techniques to organize the input features in a meaningful manner allowing the CNN method to utilize this feature organization to improve classification performance

Result:

- 

Conclusion:
