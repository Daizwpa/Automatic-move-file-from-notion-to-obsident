Quote:

- Scientists and developers have designed machine learning- and deep learning-based algorithms to perform various tasks related to tumor pathologies, such as tumor detection, classiﬁcation, grading with variant stages, diagnostic forecasting, recognition of pathological attributes, pathogenesis, and genomic mutations.
- Regrettably, there are already certain obstacles to overcome connected to artiﬁcial
intelligence deployments, such as the applicability and validation of algorithms and computational technologies, in addition to the ability to train pathologists and doctors to use these machines and their willingness to accept the results.
