Objective:

- We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of radiomics in classifying undetermined thyroid nodules into benign and malignant using ultrasonography (US).

Conclusion:

- Data from this analysis support radiomic imaging analysis using US as a means of quantiﬁcation of malignancy in thyroid nodules, without exposing patients to the risks associated with invasive FNAC sampling or surgical specimen assessment.
- Results of this analysis indicate that radiomics is a novel avenue worth exploring in the differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid lesions. CNN provided a pooled sensitivity of 85% and speciﬁcity of 82% compared to a pooled sensitivity of 90% and pooled speciﬁcity of 88% in non-CNN. CNN is designed as an automated means to adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation by using multiple building blocks: convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers of data processing [95].
- Radiomics, on the other hand, provides the beneﬁt of an objective, quick, and reproducible analysis with the ability to analyze features of the nodule that are both visible to the radiologist and textural features occult to human perception [13,14]. Studies have attempted to blend the strengths
- In conclusion, this meta-analysis of current evidence demonstrates an almost 90% reliability of radiomic imaging analyses to US in detecting malignancy within undetermined thyroid nodules.
- radiomic analyses demonstrate equal diagnostic sensitivity and speciﬁcity of identifying malignant lesions when compared to radiologists.
- Within the ﬁeld of radiomics, at present, non-CNN methods may be considered the preferred radiomic means of classifying thyroid nodules.
- Based on this meta-analysis, AI offers promising results as an avenue to be explored as we look to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and risk stratiﬁcation of thyroid nodules in the era of personalized medical and oncological patient care.

Quote:

- Radiomics is a ﬁeld that uses radiological features to inform individualized patient care.
- Increased access to healthcare and availability of modern imaging techniques such as ultrasonography (US) have led to the markedly increased detection of thyroid nodules [3].
- The American Thyroid Association (ATA), British Thyroid Association (BTA), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines recommend US as the primary imaging modality for the assessment of thyroid nodules [4–6].
- Several classiﬁcation systems (e.g., ATA, BTA, and Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS)) are utilized by radiologists to stratify the risk of malignancy for each thyroid nodule based on US features [4,5,7].
- These systems classify lesions on a scale ranging from benign to malignant based on sonographic parameters such as size, echogenicity, degree of margin, irregularity, nodule height to width ratio, extra nodular extension, and calciﬁcation [4,5,7].
- the use of radiomics could possibly circumvent the need for FNAC and surgical resection, providing a potentially more cost and time-efﬁcient assessment of thyroid nodules than what is currently practiced [20,94].
- Current data suggests radiomic imaging analysis may be capable of accurately stratifying thyroid lesions into benign and malignant based on data captured using sonographic imaging.
