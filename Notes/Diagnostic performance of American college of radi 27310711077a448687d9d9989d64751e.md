Objective:

- The objective of our study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) in the risk stratification of thyroid nodules.

Conclusion:

- ACR TI-RADS showed favorable sensitivity and moderate specifici-
ty in risk stratification of thyroid nodules. The use of ACR TI-RADS could avoid a large
number of unnecessary biopsies, although at the cost of a slight decline in sensitivity.
