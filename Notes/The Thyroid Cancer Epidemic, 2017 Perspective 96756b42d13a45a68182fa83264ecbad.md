# The Thyroid Cancer Epidemic, 2017 Perspective

Status: Not started
Task: Thyroid nodule studies
Type of paper: Epidemiology

Quotes:

- Major guidelines for thyroid nodule management recommend against general biopsy of nodules <1 cm in size. Data supporting the safety of active surveillance of low risk thyroid cancers is now recognized.
- Tumors previously labeled as encapsulated follicular variant papillary thyroid cancers are now recommended to be called non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP)
- Thyroid cancer incidence prior to the mid 1990s was relatively stable, around 5/100,000.  The incidence then increased to 15.0 in 2014, the last year of available data. Women have seen the highest increase in incidence, with 22.2 new cases per 100,000 people diagnosed in 2014.
- The rise in incidence has been due almost entirely to the most common histologic type, papillary thyroid cancer5.

Objective:

- Here we review recent incidence and mortality data, and discuss new discussions about trends in the United States. Then, we review new guidelines for thyroid cancer and other efforts to reduce the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low risk thyroid cancer.

Conclusion:

- The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased dramatically in recent decades due in large part to identification subclinical disease.
- **The rate of increase may be plateauing**, perhaps due to efforts to discourage behaviors that lead to their detection, such as aggressively biopsying small nodules and performing extensive surgeries. For people who are identified with low risk papillary thyroid cancer, the new management strategy of active surveillance holds promise as a potential path to avoid the harms of aggressive treatment while remaining cost effective.
