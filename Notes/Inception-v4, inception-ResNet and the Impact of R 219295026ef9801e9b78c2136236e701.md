Objective:

- In this report, we will compare the two pure Inception variants, Inception-v3 and v4, with similarly expensive hy-
brid Inception-ResNet versions. Admittedly, those mod-els were picked in a somewhat ad hoc manner with the
main constraint being that the parameters and computational complexity of the models should be somewhat similar
to the cost of the non-residual models. In fact we have tested bigger and wider Inception-ResNet variants and they per-
formed very similarly on the ImageNet classiÔ¨Åcation challenge.
