## **Introduction:**

According to Cao et al. [17] “data science is the science of data” or “data science is the study of data”, where a data product is a data deliverable, or data-enabled or guided, which can be a discovery, prediction, service, suggestion, insight into decision-making, thought, model, paradigm, tool, or system.

data science is the field of applying advanced analytics methods and scientific concepts to derive useful business information from data.

Basic analytics offer a description of data in general, while advanced analytics is a step forward in offering a deeper understanding of data and helping to analyze granular data, which we are interested in.

In the field of data science, several types of analytics are popular, such as "Descriptive analytics" which answers the question of what happened; "Diagnostic analytics" which answers the question of why did it happen; "Predictive analytics" which predicts what will happen in the future; and "Prescriptive analytics" which prescribes what action should be taken, discussed briefly in “Advanced analytics methods and smart computing”.

advanced analytics and decision-making based on machine learning techniques [105], a major part of artificial intelligence (AI) [102] can also play a significant role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) due to its learning capability for smart computing as well as automation [121].

The area of “data science” is huge, we mainly focus on deriving useful insights through advanced analytics, where the results are used to make smart decisions in various real-world application areas

various advanced analytics methods such as machine learning modeling, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, neural network, or deep learning analysis can provide deeper knowledge about data, and thus can be used to develop data-driven intelligent applications.

## **Background and Related Work:**

*Under this section they going to talk about various data term and works related to data science and highlight the scop of study.*

### **Data Terms and Definitions:**

Data analysis: refers to the processing of data by conventional (e.g., classic statistical, empirical, or logical) theories, technologies, and tools for extracting useful information and for practical purposes [17].

Data analytics: refers to the theories, technologies, instruments, and processes that allow for an    in-depth understanding and exploration of actionable data insight

Data mining:  defined as the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data [38]. Data sources may include databases, data centers, the Internet or Web, other repositories of data, or data dynamically streamed through the system.

Big data: is another popular term nowadays, which may change the statistical and data analysis approaches as it has the unique features of “massive, high dimensional, heterogeneous, com-plex, unstructured, incomplete, noisy, and erroneous” [74]. Big data can be generated by mobile devices, social net-works, the Internet of Things, multimedia, and many other new applications [129]. Several unique features including volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value (5Vs), and complexity are used to understand and describe big data [69].

Advanced Analytics: is characterized or defined as autonomous or semi-autonomous data or con-tent analysis using advanced techniques and methods to dis-cover deeper insights, predict or generate recommendations, typically beyond traditional business intelligence or analytics.

Machine learning: a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), is one of the major techniques used in advanced analytics which can automate analytical model building [112].

Data science: is an umbrella term that encompasses advanced data analytics, data mining, machine, and deep learning modeling, and several other related disciplines like statistics, to extract insights or useful knowledge from the datasets and transform them into actionable business strategies

### **Related Work:**

## **Understanding Data Science Modeling:**

### **Types of Real‑World Data:**

(i) Structured—that has a well-defined data structure and follows a standard order, examples are names, dates, addresses, credit card numbers, stock information, geolocation, etc.

(ii) Unstructured—has no pre-defined format or organization, examples are sensor data, emails, blog entries, wikis, and word processing documents, PDF files, audio files, videos, images, presentations, web pages, etc.

(iii) Semi-structured—has elements of both the structured and unstructured data containing certain organizational properties, examples are HTML, XML, JSON documents, NoSQL databases, etc.

(iv) Metadata—that represents data about the data, examples are author, file type, file size, creation date and time, last modification date and time, etc. [38, 105].

the data used in data-driven applications can be any of the types mentioned above, and they can differ from one application to another in the real world

### **Steps of Data Science Modeling:**

In the following, we briefly discuss each module of the data science process.

Understanding business problems: to understand and identify the business problems, the data scientists formulate relevant questions while working with the end-users and other stakeholders. the ultimate goals for addressing it, and the relevant project plan.

For instance, how much/many, which category/group, is the behavior unrealistic/abnormal, which option should be taken, what action, etc. could be relevant questions depending on the nature of the problems. This helps to get a better idea of what business needs and what we should be extracted from data.

Once the business problem has been clearly stated, the data scientist can define the analytic approach to solve the problem

Understanding data: the appropriate data or the quality of the data must be sourced and cleansed, which is fundamental to any data science engagement. For this, data assessment that evaluates what data is available and how it aligns to the business problem could be the first step in data understanding. Several aspects such as data type/format, the quantity of data whether it is sufficient or not to extract the useful knowledge, data relevance, authorized access to data, feature or attribute importance, combining multiple data sources, important metrics to report the data, etc. are needed to take into account to clearly understand the data for a particular business problem.

the data understanding module involves figuring out what data would be best needed and the best ways to acquire it.

Data pre-processing and exploration:

Thus data exploration is typically used to figure out the gist of data and to develop a first step assessment of its quality, quantity, and characteristics. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily it offers tools for creating hypotheses by generally visualizing and interpreting the data through graphical representation such as a chart, plot, histogram, etc [72, 91].

To ensure the quality of the data, the data pre-processing technique, which is typically the process of cleaning and transforming raw data [107] before processing and analysis is important. It also involves reformatting information, making data corrections, and merging data sets to enrich data.

Machine learning modeling and evaluation:

Model building is dependent on what type of analytics, e.g., predictive analytics, is needed to solve the particular problem.

Data scientists typically separate training and test subsets of the given dataset usually dividing in the ratio of 80:20 or data considering the most popular k-folds data split-ting method [38].

machine learning experts or data scientists can take into account several advanced analytics such as feature engineering, feature selection or extraction methods, algorithm tuning, ensemble methods, modifying existing algorithms, or designing new algorithms, etc. to improve the ultimate data-driven model to solve a particular business problem through smart decision making

Data product and automation:

A data product is typically the output of any data science activity [17].

A data product, in general terms, is a data deliverable, or data-enabled or guide, which can be a discovery, prediction, service, suggestion, insight into decision-making, thought, model, paradigm, tool, application, or system that process data and generate results.

## **Advanced Analytics Methods and Smart  Computing:**

### Types of Analytics and Outcome:

Descriptive analytics:

It is the interpretation of historical  data to better understand the changes that have occurred 
in a business. Thus descriptive analytics answers the  question, “what happened in the past?” by summarizing  past data such as statistics on sales and operations or marketing strategies, use of social media, and engagement  with Twitter, Linkedin or Facebook, etc.

As a result, managers and decision-makers can  pinpoint areas of strength and weakness in their business,  and eventually can take more effective management strategies and business decisions.

Diagnostic analytics:

It is a form of advanced analytics that examines data or content to answer the question, “why did it happen?” The goal of diagnostic analytics is  to help to find the root cause of the problem

 In a healthcare example, it might help to  figure out whether the patients’ symptoms such as high  fever, dry cough, headache, fatigue, etc. are all caused by  the same infectious agent.

Overall, diagnostic analytics  enables one to extract value from the data by posing the  right questions and conducting in-depth investigations  into the answers. It is characterized by techniques such as  drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations.

Predictive analytics:

It is a form  of advanced analytics that examines data or content to  answer the question, “what will happen in the future?”  Thus, the primary goal of predictive analytics is to identify and typically answer this question with a high degree  of probability.

Data scientists can use historical data as a  source to extract insights for building predictive models using various regression analyses and machine learning  techniques, which can be used in various application  domains for a better outcome.

*Example:*

 **medical  specialists to make effective decisions through predicting  patients who are at risk of diseases.

sales and customer satisfaction through understanding  and predicting customer preferences.

Thus predictive  analytics can be considered as the core analytical method  within the area of data science.

Prescriptive analytics:

Prescriptive analytics focuses on  recommending  the  best  way  forward  with  actionable  
information to maximize overall returns and profitability,  which typically answer the question, “what action should  be taken?” In business analytics, prescriptive analytics  is considered the final step.

For its models, prescriptive  analytics collects data from several descriptive and predictive sources and applies it to the decision-making process.

By integrating big data, machine learning, and  business rules, prescriptive analytics helps organizations to make more informed decisions to produce results that  drive the most successful business decisions.

In summary, to clarify what happened and why it happened,  both descriptive analytics and diagnostic analytics look at  the past. Historical data is used by predictive analytics and  prescriptive analytics to forecast what will happen in the  future and what steps should be taken to impact those effects.

## Machine Learning Based Analytical Modeling

### Regression Analysis:

Regression analysis is a form of supervised machine learning that examines the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and independent variables (predictor) to predict continuous-valued output.

Regression analysis is typically conducted for one of two purposes: to predict the value of the dependent variable in the case of individuals for whom some knowledge relating to the explanatory variables is available, or to estimate the effect of some explanatory variable on the dependent variable

Linear regression cannot be used to fit non-linear data and may cause an underfitting problem.

The regularization techniques such as Ridge, Lasso, Elastic-Net, etc. [85, 105] can be used to optimize the linear regression model.

Besides, support vector regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression techniques [85, 105] can be used for building effective regression models depending on the problem type, e.g., non-linear tasks.

### Classification Analysis

This is a form of supervised machine learning approach that also refers to a predictive modelling problem in which a class label is predicted for a given example [38].

There are several forms of classification analysis available in the area such as:

binary classification—which refers to the prediction of one of two classes;

 multi-class classification—which involves the prediction of one of more than two classes;

 multi-label classification—a generalization of multiclass classification in which the problem’s classes are organized hierarchically [105].

Several popular classification techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors [5], support vector machines [55], navies Bayes [49], adaptive boosting [32], extreme gradient boosting [85], logistic regression [66], decision trees ID3 [92], C4.5 [93], and random forests [13] exist to solve classification problems.

### Cluster Analysis

Clustering is a form of unsupervised machine learning technique and is well-known in many data science application areas for statistical data analysis [38].

Clustering techniques search for the structures inside a dataset and, if the classification is not previously identified, classify homogeneous groups of cases.

Overall, the purpose of cluster analysis is to sort various data points into groups (or clusters) that are homogeneous internally and heterogeneous externally [105]. To gain insight into how data is distributed in a given dataset or as a pre-processing phase for other algorithms, clustering is often used.

### Association Rule Analysis

Association rule learning is known as a rule-based machine learning system, an unsupervised learning method is typically used to establish a relationship among variables.

This is a descriptive technique often used to analyze large data-sets for discovering interesting relationships or patterns.

The association learning technique’s main strength is its comprehensiveness, as it produces all associations that meet user-specified constraints including minimum support and confidence value [138].

In a supermarket, for example, associations infer knowledge about the buying behaviour of consumers for different items, which helps to change the marketing and sales plan.

In healthcare, to better diagnose patients, physicians may use association guidelines. Doctors can assess the conditional likelihood of a given illness by comparing symptom associations in the data from previous cases using association rules and machine learning-based data analysis.

### Time‑Series Analysis and Forecasting

A time series is typically a series of data points indexed in time order particularly, by date, or timestamp [111]. Depending on the frequency, the time-series can be different types such as annually, e.g., annual budget, quarterly, e.g., expenditure, monthly, e.g., air traffic, weekly, e.g., sales quantity, daily, e.g., weather, hourly, e.g., stock price, minute-wise, e.g., inbound calls in a call center, and even second-wise, e.g., web traffic, and so on in relevant domains

A mathematical method dealing with such time-series data, or the procedure of fitting a time series to a proper model is termed time-series analysis.

## **Real‑World Application Domains**

- Business or financial data science
- Medical or health data science:
    
    To help organizations, improve the quality of treatment, lower the cost of care, and improve the patient experience, data can be obtained from several sources, e.g., the electronic health record, billing claims, cost estimates, and patient satisfaction surveys, etc., to analyse.
    
    In reality, healthcare analytics using machine learning modelling can minimize medical costs, predict infectious outbreaks, prevent preventable diseases, and generally improve the quality of life [81, 119].
    
    Thus health data science modelling can play a role in analysing current and historical data to predict trends, improve services, and even better monitor the spread of diseases. Eventually, it may lead to new approaches to improve patient care, clinical expertise, diagnosis, and management.

Overall, we can conclude that data science modeling can be used to help drive changes and improvements in almost every sector in our real-world life, where the relevant data is available to analyze. To gather the right data and extract useful knowledge or actionable insights from the data for making smart decisions is the key to data science modeling in any application domain. Based on our discussion on the above ten potential real-world application domains by taking into account data-driven smart computing and decision making, we can say that the prospects of data science and the role of data scientists are huge for the future world. The “Data Scientists” typically analyze information from multiple sources to better understand the data and business problems, and develop machine learning-based analytical mode-ling or algorithms, or data-driven tools, or solutions, focused on advanced analytics, which can make today’s computing process smarter, automated, and intelligent.

## **Challenges and Research Directions**

Understanding the real-world business problems and associated data including nature

the extraction of the relevant and accurate information from the collected data

Understanding and selecting the appropriate analytical methods to extract the useful insights for smart decision-making for a particular business problem is the main issue in the area of data science.

The traditional data-driven models or systems typically use a large amount of business data to generate data-driven decisions. In several application fields, however, the new trends are more likely to be interesting and useful for modelling and predicting the future than older ones.

Therefore, to propose the new techniques by taking into account the recent data patterns, and consequently to build a recency-based data-driven model for solving real-world problems, is another significant challenging issue in the area

The most crucial task for a data-driven smart system is to create a framework that supports data science modelling.

As a result, a well-designed data-driven framework, as well as experimental evaluation, is a very important direction to effectively solve a business problem in a particular domain, as well as a big challenge for the data scientists

In several important application areas such as autonomous cars, criminal justice, health care, recruitment, housing, management of the human resource, public safety, where decisions made by models, or AI agents, have a direct effect on human lives.

If we can explain the result in a meaningful way, then the model can be better trusted by the end-user.

For machine-learned models, new trust properties yield new trade-offs, such as privacy versus accuracy; robustness versus efficiency; fairness versus robustness.

Therefore, incorporating trustworthy AI particularly, data-driven or machine learning modeling could be another challenging issue in the area.
