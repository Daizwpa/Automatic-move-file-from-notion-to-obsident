Objective:

- we review the potential utility of central neck lymph node dissection as well as the risks of performing this procedure.
- we review the potential of molecular testing to stratify patients who would most benefit from this procedure.
    
    

Quote:

- Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) makes up approximately 74â€“85% of all forms of thyroid cancer.
- The incidence of PTC has been rising in the United States over the past 30 years from 3.6 per 100,000 in 1973 to 9.1 per 100,000 (females) and 2.9 per 100,000 (males) in 2011 (1).
- Most of this increase in PTC can be attributed to the incidental finding of small tumors (<1 cm) as a result of the increased use of ultrasound and computed tomography scans for a variety of other conditions.
- PTC is more common in women, whereas in men it tends to be more aggressive and occurs at a later age.
- Patients with PTC tend to have an excellent prognosis with an overall 10-year survival of 93% (2).
