I think they made things up

Objective:

- This paper intends to propose a new thyroid diagnosis method that incorporates both the feature extraction and classification process.
- For feature extraction, a novel algorithm is used to extract both the image and data features for diagnosing purpose. We introduce a new hybrid algorithm WF-CS algorithm to select the optimal features.
