Objective:

- The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of the BRAFV600E mutation in tumor samples and its association with high-risk clinico-pathologic features prospectively.

Objective:

- The aim of the present study was **to evaluate the prevalence of the BRAFV600E mutation in patients diagnosed with PTC** and **to analyze the association between high-risk clinicopathologic characteristics and the BRAFV600E mutation in a large Korean population of PTC patients.**

Conclusion:

- The BRAFV600E mutation is associated with high-risk clinicopathologic characteristics in patients with PTC, and **the proportion of this mutation is significantly related to a number of high-risk factors for tumor recurrence.** Therefore, the BRAFV600E mutation may be a potential prognostic indicator for PTC patients. Future studies will be needed to demonstrate a potential role for the BRAFV600E mutation as an indicator of poor prognosis.

Task:

- Collect information related to 547 PTC patients who underwent surgery, between the period February 2009 to January 2010.
- use Polymerase chain reaction to amplify exon 15 of the BRAF gene from paraffin-embedded thyroid tumor specimens, followed by direct sequencing to detect the BRAFV600E mutation.
- Perform both univariate and multivariate to analyze associations between the BRAFV600E mutation and clinicopathologic features.

Results:

- BRAFV600E was found existed in in 381/547 (69.7%) patients with primary PTC.
- TheBRAFV600E mutation was signiﬁcantly associated with age (C45 years), tumor size ([1 cm), extrathyroidal extension, and cervical lymph node metastases (P\0.05).
- Multiple logistic regression showed that it was signiﬁcantly associated with gender (OR = 1.834;
95% CI 1.021–3.463), tumor size (OR = 1.972; 95% CI 1.250–3.103), and extra-thyroidal extension (OR = 2.428; 95% CI 1.484–3.992), but not with age, multifocality, lymph node metastases, and advanced disease stage.
- The proportion of BRAFV600E mutation was signiﬁcantly associated with the number of high-risk factors of tumor recurrence (P\0.001).

Conclusion:

- The BRAFV600E mutation was associated with high-risk clinicopathologic characteristics in patients with PTC. The BRAFV600E mutation may be a potential prognostic factor in PTC patients.

Quotes:

- The B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) mutation is the most common genetic alteration in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) [1].
- Of the three forms of Raf kinase, BRAF is the most potent activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [2], which plays a major role in the regulation of cell growth, division, and proliferation [3, 4].
- The T1779A point mutation in BRAF exon 15, resulting in a V600E amino acid substitution, is the most common and represents more than 90% of all the mutations found in the BRAF gene [2].
- Although in the majority of patients PTC shows an indolent course and favourable prognosis [5], in some PTC can spread, recur after initial treatment, and cause death [6].
- The clinical outcome may be affected by high-risk clinicopathologic characteristics such as older age at diagnosis, male gender, large tumor size, the presence of extrathyroidal extension, lymph node and distant metastases, and an advanced disease stage [7–9].
- The prevalence of the BRAFV600E mutation is highly variable, ranging from 29 to 83% in PTC [18].
- Prevalence of the BRAFV600E mutation in PTC is much higher (52–83%) in Korea than in other countries (30–49%) [19].
- This discrepancy is thought to be due to the lack of any prospective studies reducing the selection bias, small numbers in the study populations, the lack of multivariate analysis in most studies, and the heterogeneous histological subtypes within PTC.
