Introduction:

Beyond the physical labor support offered by machines, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is a key technological advancement that has enabled humans to replace manual work with superior mental capacities and intellectual levels in a variety of industries.

Consequently, a key attraction of AI is that it can perform a variety of human-like functions, learn from experience and adapt to new inputs and settings. To attain superior performance for
speciﬁed tasks, AI makes use of relevant information sources such as Big Data

AI has already digitally transformed the manual health system into an automated version in many areas, whereby in some applications, humans are now only required to perform more fundamental duties in medical practice to manage patients and medical resources
