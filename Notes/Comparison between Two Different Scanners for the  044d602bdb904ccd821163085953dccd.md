Objective:

- The aim of this study was to compare two different tomographs for the evaluation of the
role of semiquantitative PET/CT parameters and radiomics features (RF) in the prediction of thyroid incidentalomas (TIs) at 18F-FDG imaging.

Task:

- Collect 221 patient retrospectively.
- 

Results:

- On the basis of the resulting evidence we identiﬁed some remarkable points concerning the effect of different PET scanners on RF extraction and the predictive features and associated models.
- 

Conclusion:

- In conclusion, our study enabled the selection of some RF that are able to predict with a certain good accuracy, the ﬁnal nature of TIs discovered at 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Classic semiquantitative and volumetric PET/CT parameters did not reveal this ability. Furthermore, a good overlap in the extraction of RF between the two scanners was underlined.
