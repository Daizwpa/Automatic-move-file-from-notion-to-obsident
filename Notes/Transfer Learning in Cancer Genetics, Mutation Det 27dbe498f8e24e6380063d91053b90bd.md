Objective:

- The aim of our study is to review the current uses of transfer learning in genetic research.
- We aim to overview some of the uses of transfer learning in human genetic research, such as in **gene expression**, **mutation**, **genetic syndrome detection**, and **genotype‚Äìphenotype association.**

Transform learning can divided into three types:

- Transudative Transform learning:  (which uses labeled data in the source domain
and un-labeled data in the target domain).
- Inductive Transform learning: (which uses labeled data in target domain).
- Unsupervised Transform learning: (which does not use labeled data at all).

- Genes are responsible for cells‚Äô function; to do this function, multiple components are involved. Each gene is made up of different sections, like a promotor sequence, various exons, and introns [17‚Äì19].

- Mutation:
    - Mutation is defined as a change in a DNA sequence.
    - There are many types of genetic mutations affecting genes and chromosomes [26,27].
    - These mutations can affect the gene expression or the protein function and structure [28] and are a cornerstone for many diseases and genetic diseases (e.g., thalassemia) [29‚Äì31].
    - Mutations in genes regulating cell growth or cell death are a common and crucial pathophysiological change seen in cancers.
    - Mutations cause cancer and can affect the disease course, progression, patient‚Äôs survival, and treatment options [29,36].
    - Thus, identifying these mutations in cancer patients is of various clinical importance.

- Limitations and Challenges facing Transfer learning :
    - domain dissimilarity: domain mismatch is a significant issue. Additionally, the
    necessity for extensive pre-training data poses challenges, especially in specialized fields with limited datasets.
    - Reliance on large pre-training datasets
    - lack of explainable techniques
    - Low-quality data and the ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù nature of this model further
    complicate its reliability and interpretability, hindering its effective application across various domains [14].
    - Using the incorrect source domain to train the model can reduce its performance in the target domain, a phenomenon known as negative transfer [119].
    - TL is a proposed method to reduce overfitting. However, an inappropriate source domain or the addition of too many parameters can also reduce the generalizability and cause overfitting of the TL model [12].
    
    These disadvantages are important to notice, especially when there are no relevant source domains for the task.

Conclusion:

- In conclusion, TL enhances AI efficiency by improving mutation prediction, gene expression analysis, and genetic syndrome detection. Future studies should focus on increasing domain similarities, expanding databases, and incorporating clinical data for better predictions.
