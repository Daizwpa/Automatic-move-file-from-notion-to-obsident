Objective:

- In this review we summarize the state of current knowledge as pertinent to bony metastatic disease in thyroid cancer, including clinical implications, impacts on patient function and quality of life, pathogenesis, and therapeutic opportunities, proposing approaches to patient care accordingly.

Results:

Conclusion:

- In this regard, RAI imaging (iodine avid follicular cell derived thyroid cancers only), FDG-PET, or gallium dotatate-PET, are preferable imaging approaches with regard to detecting OMs.

Quotes:

- bone metastases are more frequent in follicular and medullary thyroid cancers, requiring closer bone surveillance in patients with these histologies.
- Emerging data also suggest that treatments such as multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) can be less eﬀective in controlling bone, as opposed to other (e.g. lung), metastases in thyroid cancers, making special attention to bone critical even in the setting of active MKI therapy.
- Osseous metastases (OMs) occur in only ~4% of all thyroid cancer (TC) patients and are consequently poorly studied but nevertheless associated with considerably heightened morbidity and mortality [1-3].
- poorly diﬀerentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC), having worse 10-year OS of only 15% [6].
- OMs are at least twice more frequent in follicular (FTC, 7–28%) than in papillary DTC patients (PTC, 1.4–7%) [3,11], and occur also at similarly higher (16–19%) frequency in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) patients [3,14],
- **Patients with FTC and MTC were more likely to develop bone metastases [OR 2.25 95% CI 1.85–2.74 and OR 2.16 CI 1.60–2.86, respectively]**
- **Metastases, including OMs, arise from a multistep process involving loss of cell-to-cell adhesion, invasion, and dissemination through the blood and/or lymphatics, and deposition in receptive end organs/tissues (depicted in Fig. 1).**
