Objective:

- This study was designed to examine whether available preoperative clinical parameters, including B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) V600E mutation status, **can identify patients at risk for central compartment lymph node metastasis (CLNM).**
- the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether age, tumor size, gender,
and/or BRAF mutation status can be utilized to predict CLNM in patients with PTC, thus providing the preoperative risk stratiﬁcation necessary to guide appropriate management of the central compartment.
- 

Conclusion:

- Of the commonly used clinical parameters available preoperatively, the BRAF V600E mutation is the only independent predictor of CLNM in PTC and can be utilized to guide the extent of initial surgery.

Quotes:

- Recent evidence has focused on the B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) V600E mutation as a novel prognostic marker that may prove useful in stratifying this risk. Present in *45 % of cases, this somatic mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration observed in PTC.12 In many reports, BRAF V600E-positive mutation status has been associated with lymph node metastasis, which in turn is thought to be predictive of an increased risk of tumor recurrence.13–15 Previous studies also have examined the utility of BRAF mutation testing in optimizing the surgical management of PTC and have suggested that BRAF-positive patients may beneﬁt from more extensive initial surgery, including performance of CND.16,17
