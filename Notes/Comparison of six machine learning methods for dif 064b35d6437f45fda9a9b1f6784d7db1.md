Objective:

- Comparison SVM, LDA, RF, LG, KNN in terms of accuracy, sensitivityâ€¦

Tasks:

- Collect total of 525 patients with thyroid nodules (malignant 228, benign 297).
- Construct six machine learning SVM, LDA, RF, LG, GlmNet, K-NN. using 13 sonographic features.
- Apply 10-fold cross validation

Results:

- The logistic regression algorithm had better diagnostic performance than the other ML algorithms.
- The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV, and AUC obtained by running logistic regression were 86.48%, 83.33%, 88.89%, 87.42%, 85.20%, and 92.84%, respectively.
