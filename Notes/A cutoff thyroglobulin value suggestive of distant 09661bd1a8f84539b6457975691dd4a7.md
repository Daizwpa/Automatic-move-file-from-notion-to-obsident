Objective:

- Serum thyroglobulin is used as part of the early postoperative assessment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) since there is a clear relationship between an increased risk of recurrence and persistent disease after initial treatment and high postoperative stimulated thyroglobulin (ps-Tg) values. Thus, although ps-Tg above 10–30 ng/mL is considered an independent predictor of worse prognosis, the value that is associated with distant metastases is not defined. Thus, this was our objective.

Results:

- Our findings demonstrated that ps-Tg could predict distant metastasis in DTC patients. We identified a cut-off of 117.5 ng/mL with a high negative predictive value of 93.7%.
- Most of the study population was female (79.7%) and younger than 45 years at diagnosis. Histological examination indicated that a papillary pattern (92.1%)
- Regarding initial therapy, 73.4% of patients had total thyroidectomy without neck dissection. Microcarcinomas represented 25.3% of tumors and a minority of tumors were larger than 4 cm (17.7%).

Conclusion:

- In summary, our results confirmed the clinical value of ps-Tg for identifying distant metastases. We suggest a cutoff of 117.5 ng/mL, with high negative predictive value (93.7%), to reliably exclude the presence of both pulmonary and bone metastasis in patients with DTC. Our findings demonstrated that assessment of ps-Tg levels may be a good prognostic tool and useful for distinguishing patients who may need more aggressive therapy. Congruently determining ps-Tg levels can minimize treatment-related morbidity and unnecessary procedures. We believe that ps-Tg could be considered as a marker with good accuracy in postoperative risk stratification of DTC patients, with a possible significant impact on their management and follow-up decisions.

Quote:

- The 5-year survival rate for thyroid cancer is 98.1% (3). Although the overall response to treatment is frequently excellent, the rate of recurrent or persistent cases varies from 23 to 30% (5).
- Patients with DTC who develop distant metastases usually have a worse prognosis (6,7). The most common sites of distant metastasis are the lungs and bones (4,8,9), and the early diagnosis of these metastases is essential for adequate treatment and a better response to therapy (8).
- Conversely, some studies associate greater ps-Tg values with worse prognosis in DTC patients. In one prospective study, a ps-Tg threshold of 45 ng/mL was considered appropriate to indicate RIT (31). Two other studies (34,35) reported that elevated Tg levels (45–6 ng/mL) may be a predictor of failing ablation, after administration of RIT doses of 30 mCi (34) and 100 mCi (35), suggesting that higher Tg levels could be correlated with a more aggressive tumor profile.
- some studies have found an association between high ps-Tg values (410–30 ng/mL) and poor overall survival, lower disease free survival (11,13,33), and in some multivariate analyses, a greater risk of persistent or recurrent disease (11,12,36).
