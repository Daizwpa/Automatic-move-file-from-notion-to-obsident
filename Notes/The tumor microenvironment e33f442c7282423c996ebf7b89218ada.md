A tumor is not simply a group of cancer cells, but rather a heterogeneous collection of inﬁltrating
and resident host cells, secreted factors and extracellular matrix. Tumor cells stimulate signiﬁcant molecular, cellular and physical changes within their host tissues to support tumor growth and progression.

- Information about the microenvironment:
    - The composition of the tumor microenvironment varies between
    tumor types, but hallmark features include immune cells, stromal cells,
    blood vessels, and extracellular matrix.
    - It is believed that the “tumor microenvironment is not just a silent bystander, but rather an active promoter of cancer progression” (Trufﬁ et al., 2020).
    - 
- Information about the immune cells:
    - Immune cells are critical components of the tumor microenvironment. Depending on the context, a dichotomy exists in the relationship between immune cells and the tumor microenvironment: immune cells can either suppress tumor growth or promote it (Figure 1).
    - The role of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment can be to either suppress tumor formation (anti-tumor microenvironment) or promote tumorigenesis (immune-suppressive microenvironment). Depending on context and tumor type, immune cells can be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic.
