- The use of ultrasound in the clinical evaluation of patients
with thyroid lesions has expanded from the detection of
nonpalpable thyroid nodules to:
    - include the delineation of benign and malignant thyroid lesions,
    - the examination of lymph node basins for staging purposes and treatment planning,
    - fine-needle aspiration (FNA) guidance for thyroid nodules or suspicious-appearing lymph nodes,
    - intraoperative localization of thyroid lesions and/or lymph nodes, and postoperative surveillance for recurrent thyroid cancer (Table 1) [1‚Äì7]. C

- Since the late 1960s, ultrasound has become essential in the examination of the thyroid gland with the increased availability of high-frequency linear array transducers and computer-enhanced imaging capabilities of modern day portable ultrasound equipment in a clinic or office-based  setting.
- Ultrasound has become useful in the qualitative characterization of thyroid nodules based on benign or malignant features.

- The superiority of thyroid ultrasound over physical examination
allows for  the evaluation and characterization of:
    - thyroid nodules,
    - the entire thyroid gland
    - cervical lymph nodes
    
     which may change management in 60% of patients who have been referred for a solitary thyroid nodule [4].

- Intraoperative ultrasound has been used to determine the optimal neck incision location and to localize difficult and nonpalpable lesions intraoperatively for surgical removal.
- Ultrasound can also be used to monitor for recurrent disease in those patients who have undergone surgical resection for thyroid cancer.

- Although no single ultrasound feature carries a high sensitivity and positive predictive value for thyroid cancer, there is evidence to suggest that a number of ultrasound characteristics, when occurring together, are associated with a higher risk for malignancy [11, 12].

- Recent evidence also suggests that preoperative ultrasound may alter the planned surgical procedure in cases where newly discovered multifocal thyroid cancer with regional metastasis may alert the surgeon to perform a total thyroidectomy with extended neck dissection [1, 5].
