Results:

- The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the CAD system were 92.5%, 96.4% and 83.1%, respectively, which were higher than those of the experienced attending radiologists. The areas under the ROC curves of the CAD system and the attending radiologists were 0.881 and 0.819, respectively.

Conclusion:

- The CAD system for thyroid nodules exhibited a better diagnostic performance than experienced attending radiologists. The CAD system could be a reliable supplementary tool to diagnose thyroid nodules using ultrasonography. Macroscopic features in ultrasound images, such as the margins and shape of thyroid nodules, could influence the diagnostic efficiency of the CAD system.

Quote:

- ultrasonography has some limitations as a diagnostic tool for thyroid nodules. The detectability of thyroid nodules depends on certain macroscopic features in ultrasound images, such as their composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, calcification and echogenic foci.
- the accuracy of CAD systems for thyroid nodules on ultrasonography images has reached to 85%-90% [15-17].
