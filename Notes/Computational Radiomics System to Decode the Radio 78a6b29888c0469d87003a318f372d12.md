Key word: Medical image analysis, Pyradiomics, Python, Radiomics, feature extraction
Status: Done
Type of paper: AI-Experiment, Experimental article

Objective:

- To address this issue, we developed PyRadiomics, a flexible open-source platform capable of extracting a large panel of engineered features from medical images. PyRadiomics is implemented in Python and can be used standalone or using 3D-Slicer. Here, we discuss the workflow and architecture of PyRadiomics and
demonstrate its application in characterizing lung-lesions. Source code, documentation, and
examples are publicly available at [www.radiomics.io](http://www.radiomics.io/). With this platform, we aim to establish a
reference standard for radiomic analyses, provide a tested and maintained resource, and to grow
the community of radiomic developers addressing critical needs in cancer research.
