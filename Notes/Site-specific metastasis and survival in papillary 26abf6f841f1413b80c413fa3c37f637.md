Objective:

- To study the consequences of different distant metastasis sites on the survival of PTC patients to better understand their association with survival outcomes, which will help clinicians to develop tailored treatment plans.
- The aims of the current nationwide study were to :
    - (1) determine the impact of single and multi-organ distant metastases on survival;
    - (2) assess the differential consequence of speciﬁc metastatic sites on survival;
    - (3) identify factors that predict survival in patients with distant metastasis in a diverse population representing wider geographic regions in the United States.

Tools:

- Population-based cancer registries provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the relationship between the patterns of distant metastases and prognosis in metastatic cancer.

Conclusion:

- Our results showed that metastasis to specific organs appear to affect prognosis. The 5-year survival rate was 6% and 12% for patients with brain and liver metastases, respectively. While bone and liver are 25% and 21%, respectively.
- Risk factors that significantly influence overall survival were male gender, multiple organ involvement, and brain metastasis.
- Interestingly, the outcomes drastically decline in patients exhibiting multi-organ metastasis, with a 5-year survival rate of 15.3%, compared to 77.6% for patients with single-organ metastasis [13].

Quote:

- Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common subtypes of thyroid malignancy, and its distant metastasis (DM) is linked with higher mortality.
- Primary thyroid cancers (TC) are histologically divided into four groups—**(I) well-differentiated epithelial thyroid cancers**, **(II) poorly differentiated epithelial thyroid cancers**, **(III) medullary thyroid cancers**, and **(IV) rare thyroid tumors (lymphoma, sarcoma, squamous cell, etc.)** [3].
- Well-differentiated epithelial thyroid cancer includes either papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), or Hurthle cell thyroid cancer (HCTC) [4].
- PTC arises from the follicular cells of the normal thyroid gland. It is characterized by a papillary growth pattern of tumor cells with distinctive nuclear features as (1) overlapping and enlarged nuclei; (2) pale and optically clear; and (3) nuclear membrane irregularities [5]. Several PTC variants have been identiﬁed, presenting different prognosis and outcome [6].
- **tall-cell variants (TV-PTCs) and diffuse sclerosing variants (DSVs) are aggressive PTCs**.
- TV-PTCs compose 10% of all PTCs and are characterized by cells that are two times taller than in a classical PTC.
- DSV-PTCs represent 3% of all PTCs and include psammoma bodies and extensive calciﬁcation.
- These (TV-PTC and DSV-PTC) aggressive histological subtypes are associated with thyroid invasion, regional and distant metastasis.
- They present a signiﬁcant reduction of patient overall survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 87.5% and 80.6% for DSV-PTC and TV-PTC, respectively [7–9].
- **Around 30% to 40% of PTC metastasize to regional lymph nodes [5,12]**. **However, distant metastasis may occur and accounts for 1–4% of the patients, reducing the survival rates to 24–76% [1,10].**
- **The lungs and the bones are the most common sites for distant metastasis [10,13].**
