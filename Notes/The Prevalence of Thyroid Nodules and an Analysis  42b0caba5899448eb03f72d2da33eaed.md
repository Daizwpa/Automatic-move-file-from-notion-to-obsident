Number Of Patient: 6324
Type of paper: Cross-sectional investigation

Problematic:

- investigated the prevalence of TNs in Beijing communities and analyzed its correlation to certain lifestyle factors.

Quotes:

- Thyroid nodules (TNs) are among the common diseases of the endocrine system, with 3%–7% prevalence by palpation [1].
- The prevalence by high-resolution ultrasonography among randomly  selected individuals is 19%–67% [2], with annual increasing trends worldwide.
- 5% to 15% of TNs is thyroid cancer [3], which has become the fastest growing cancer.

Results:

- The overall prevalence rate was 49.0%, and the age-standardized prevalence was 40.1%, which increased signiﬁcantly as age increased (p < 0.001).
- The prevalence was signiﬁcantly higher in females compared to males (p < 0.001), and it was signiﬁcantly higher among female current smokers and former smokers compared to non-smokers (p = 0.007).

Conclusion:

- Our ﬁndings indicate that there is a high prevalence of TNs in Beijing, with a higher prevalence in females than in males. Moreover, the prevalence increases as age increases.
- Smoking and Body mass index are independent risk factors for TNs. Therefore, intervention against smoking and weight loss might help reduce the risk of TN occurrence.
