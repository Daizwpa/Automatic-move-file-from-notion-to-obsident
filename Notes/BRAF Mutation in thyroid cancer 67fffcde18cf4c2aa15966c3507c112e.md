- BRAF Mutation info:
    - it is the most common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer, occurring in about 45% of sporadic papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs)
    - It is relatively aggressive subtypes, such as the tall-cell PTC.
    - This mutation is mutually exclusive with other common genetic alterations, supporting its independent oncogenic role, as demonstrated
    by transgenic mouse studies that showed BRAF mutation-initiated development of PTC and its transition to anaplastic thyroid cancer

- The T1799A BRAF mutation info:
    - occurs exclusively in PTC and PTC-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer
    - It is a speciÔ¨Åc diagnostic marker for this cancer when identiÔ¨Åed in cytological and histological specimens.
    - This mutation is associated with a poorer clinicopatho-logical outcome and is a novel independent molecular prognostic marker in the risk evaluation of
    thyroid cancer.
