# How to do a systematic review

Status: Done
Type: Journal
Type of paper: review paper

Why do you need systematic review:

- to provide patients with the best possible care and treatment, healthcare decisions should be based on up-to-date, high-quality research evidence.
- There is unmanageably large and continually growing  research evidence, and there is no-time to keep up-to-date.
- to avoid research waste by  ensuring that new primary research is done with full knowledge of what has already is one with full knowledge of what has already been done, and that new research evidence is interpreted in the light of what is already known.

What is a systematic review?

- A systematic review aims to bring evidence together to answer a pre-defined research question. This involves the identification of all primary research relevant to the defined review question, the critical appraisal of this research, and the synthesis of the findings.

Planning systematic review:

- What is the research question?
    - A systematic review should be prompted by an interest in a topic, and a wish to answer specific question. The question should clarify the problem to address, specifying the particular population to which the question applies as well as intervention and outcomes of interest.
- Is a systematic review needed?
    - For any research to be justiﬁed, including systematic reviews, the research question must address what is important to patients and clinicians.11 *( you have emphasize your research question!)*
        - If a research question is of low priority to the people affected by the condition, or important outcomes are not considered, or the intervention is considered unacceptable to patients, or too costly to deliver, the further research can be wasteful.
- Feasibility and the scope of  systematic review
    - It is estimated that a typical systematic review will take at least 12 months to complete, although this could be less, depending on the review and the available resources.
- What sort of systematic review best suits the research question?

Quote:

- High quality up-to-date systematic reviews are essential in order to help healthcare practitioners and researchers keep up-to-date with a large and rapidly growing body of evidence.
- Systematic reviews answer pre-defined research questions using explicit, reproducible methods to identify, critically appraise and combine results of primary research studies
- Key stages in the production of systematic reviews include clarification of aims and methods in a protocol, finding relevant research, collecting data, assessing study quality, synthesizing evidence, and interpreting findings.
- Systematic reviews may address different types of questions, such as question about effectiveness of interventions, diagnosis test accuracy, prognosis, prevalence or incidence of disease, accuracy of measurement instruments, or qualitative data.
- For all reviews, it is important to define criteria such as the population, intervention, comparison and outcomes, and to identify potential risks of bias.
- Essential features of systematic reviews include explicit, reproducible methods for identiﬁcation of primary research studies and critical assessment and synthesis of studies that meet the eligibility criteria.3,20,51,52
