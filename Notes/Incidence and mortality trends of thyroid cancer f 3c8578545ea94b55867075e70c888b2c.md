Task: Over-diagnosis, epidemiology study
Journal Name: Swiss medical weekly 
Type of paper: Epidemiology

Objective:

- The aim of the study was to report 37-year trends in incidence of papillary vs non-papillary thyroid cancer and in mortality due to thyroid cancer in general in the canton of Zurich and compare them with other European rates.

> Results:
> 
> - Our results show:
>     - significantly increasing age-standardised incidence rates of thyroid cancer over time in both sexes, mainly due to papillary thyroid cancer,
>     - the most frequent histological subtype, and the only subtype for which a significant increase was observed.
>     - It is possible that many indolent thyroid cancers, and more specifically papillary microcarcinomas, are increasingly diagnosed, which may not lead to symptoms if undetected.
>     
> - Therefore, targeted diagnostic strategies are necessary to avoid overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer. Nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude a partly true increase.

Quote:

- Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer worldwide [1]. With nearly 570,000 cased being diagnosed globally in 2018, thyroid cancer accounts for 3.1% of all cancer cases (1.4% in men and 5.0% in women)[2].
- This global trend appears to be mainly driven by papillary thyroid cancer and could reflect the growing scrutiny of the thyroid gland with ultrasonography and other diagnostic techniques such as fine-needle aspiration biopsies [3, 5, 10] and has been interpreted as overdiagnosis in other studies.
- Overdiagnosis is the detection and histological verification of a disease that would not have been diagnosed in a person’s lifetime if testing had not been performed.
- Between 2008 and 2012, over 830,000 women and 220,000 men might have been overdiagnosed with thyroid cancer in 26 countries analysed; in South Korea the estimated proportion of thyroid cancer cases attributable to overdiagnosis was 83% in men and 93% in women [10].
- For the period 2008–2012, most countries reported mortality rates between 0.2 and 0.4 per 100,000 in men and between 0.2 and 0.6 per 100,000 in women (3, 11–14].
