Objective:

- To  summarize a number of the lessons learned over 5 years of cancer genome sequencing and discuss their implications for our understanding of cancer progression and aging.

Summary:

- Introduction:
    - Not all mutation has somatic impact and most of mutation are harmless.
    - the Mutation can lead to preferential growth or survival of clone called (driver mutation) "selective advantage".
    - The Mutation that have neither phenotypic consequences or biological effects that are not selectively advantageous to the clone called **passenger mutation**.
    - Cancer is product of somatic cell evolution.
    - Cancer is disease in which an autonomous clone of cells escapes from both the in-build programs of normal somatic cell behavior and the exogenous restraints on cell proliferation.
    
- A very brief history of somatic mutation and cancer:
    - 

Quotes:

- **The majority of these mutations do not have a noticeable effect, but some can alter key cellular functions**. Early somatic mutations can cause developmental disorders, whereas the progressive accumulation of mutations throughout life can lead to cancer and contribute to aging.
- **Genome sequencing** has **revolutionized** our understanding of somatic mutation in cancer, providing a detailed view of the mutational processes and genes that drive cancer.
- **Although most of the somatic mutations that steadily accumulate in our cells are harmless, occasionally a mutation affects a gene or regulatory element and leads to a phenotypic consequence.**
- A fraction of these mutations can confer a selective advantage to the cell, leading to preferential growth or survival of a clone.
- We use the term “driver mutation” to denote mutations under positive selection within a
population of cells, and we use “passenger mutation” for variants that have either no phenotypic
consequences or biological effects that are not selectively advantageous to the clone (1).
    - One end product of somatic   is cancer, a disease in which an autonomous clone of cells escapes from both **the in-built programs of normal somatic cell behavior** and **the exogenous restraints on cell proliferation.**
    - Cancer results from the **clonal** expansion of a single abnormal cell.
- The causal role of somatic mutations in cancer was later supported by the discovery that many carcinogenic chemicals are also mutagenic (2).
- Conclusive evidence came from studies showing that the introduction of DNA fragments from cancer cells into normal cells led to malignant transformation and also from the identification of the responsible mutations in the transforming DNA (1).
