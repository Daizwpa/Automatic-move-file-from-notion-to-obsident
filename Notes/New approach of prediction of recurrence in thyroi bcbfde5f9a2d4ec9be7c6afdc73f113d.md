Note:

**several factors are associated with a higher**, such as **extrathyroidal extension**, **nodal metastasis,** and **BRAF gene mutation.**

Larger tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis, and pathological tumor types have been reported to have a higher recurrence rate.[9]

The 2015 American Thyroid Associated guideline describes several factors that affect the risk of recurrence, such as extrathyroidal extension, lymph node involvement, multifocality, and BRAF gene mutation status.[11]

Problematic:

**postoperative recurrence is the primary cause of death in thyroid cancer patients**. **Reoperations
for recurrent thyroid cancer can cause serious complications in the patient’s physical and mental health**. **In addition to accurate preoperative assessment and proper treatment, accurate risk stratiﬁcation with close-follow-up to reduce recurrence and detect recurrence early are necessary.**

predicting disease recurrence and prognosis in patients undergoing thyroidectomy is clinically difﬁcult.

Objective:

to assess rules for prediction of thyroid cancer recurrence from our institutional database using inductive logic programming.

Task:

Collect data 785 cases. (93.1% no-recurrence, 6.9 recurrence) 

Ration out the dataset to training 624 (79.5%) and test 161 cases (20.5%).

DELMIA Process Rules Discovery was used for analysis.

Inductive logic programming was used to extract rules that represents algorithms to predict recurrence.

Result:

In agreement with these results, our study suggests that early postoperative thyroglobulin could be
employed in risk stratiﬁcation using a serum thyroglobulin level of<2ng/mL as a cut-off to guide adjuvant therapy and determine the frequency of surveillance in patients with lower early postoperative thyroglobulin.[18]

In the validation group, 11 (7.0%) recurrences were observed among the 159 patients (Table 2).
For all created rules, the average prediction success rate was 95.7%. Of the 14 cases with recurrence, only 10 were correctly predicted to be positive for recurrence (success rate 71.4%), whereas 98% of the cases without recurrence were correctly predicted to be negative for recurrence (Tables 3 and 4).
