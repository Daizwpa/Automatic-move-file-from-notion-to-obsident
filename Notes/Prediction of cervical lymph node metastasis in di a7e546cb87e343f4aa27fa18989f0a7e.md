Objective:

- This study aimed to explore and summarize a more objective approach to detect cervical malignant lymph node metastasis of DTC via radiomics models.

Method:

- PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for all eligible studies. Articles using radiomics models based on ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging to assess cervical lymph node metastasis preoperatively were included.
- Characteristics and diagnostic accuracy measures were extracted.
- Bias and applicability judgments were evaluated by the revised QUADAS-2 tool.
- The estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Additionally, the leave-one-out method was conducted to assess the heterogeneity.

Results:

- Twenty-nine radiomics studies with 6160 validation set patients were included in the qualitative analysis, and 11 studies with 3863 validation set patients were included in the meta-analysis.
- Four of them had an external independent validation set.
- The studies were heterogeneous, and a significant risk of bias was found in 29 studies.
- Meta-analysis showed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis via US-based radiomics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91),

Conclusion:
