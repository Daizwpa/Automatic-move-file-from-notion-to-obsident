Key word: Overdiagnosis, Overtreatment, active surveillance, low-risk thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid microcarcinoma
Status: Done
Task: Over-diagnosis
Type of paper: review paper

Objective:

- This review summarizes the current knowledge and future perspectives of active surveillance in low-risk PTC.

Conclusion:

- overdiagnosis of indolent low-risk PTCs is a global phenomenon leading to overtreatment in many cases without any beneÔ¨Åcial effect on survival and patients‚Äô well-being.

Quotes:

- Extensive implementation of cancer screening and wide availability of neck ultrasound or other imaging studies is the main reason responsible for this phenomenon *(for increasing the incidence rate of thyroid cancer).*
- Current ATA guidelines propose less extensive preoperative diagnostics and, if differentiated thyroid cancer is diagnosed, less aggressive surgical approach and limit indications for postoperative radioiodine therapy. **However**, in intrathyroidal PTMCs in the absence of lymph node or distant metastases, active surveillance may constitute alternative management with a low progression rate of 1%‚Äì5% and without any increase in the risk of poorer outcomes related to delayed surgery in patients, in whom it was necessary.
- Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. The vast majority of patients, more than 90%, are diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Among them, 89.8% have papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 4.5% follicular thyroid carcinoma, and 1.8% Hurthle cell carcinoma. The remaining cases are diagnosed with medullary thyroid carcinoma (1.6%) or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (0.8%) (1).
- Currently, thyroid carcinoma is the most common cancer in Korean women. It has been estimated that thyroid cancer will be the four most common malignancy by 2030 (6).

Only 38% of thyroid cancers produce clinical symptoms such as

- a neck lump,
- throat and neck discomfort,
- swallowing difficulties,
- and rarely cough,
- voice change,
- dyspnea.

 symptoms related to a metastatic disease that prompt patients to start diagnostics (8)

IS OVERDIAGNOSIS THE MAIN REASON OF A GROWING INCIDENCE OF LOW-RISK PTC?

- scrutiny diagnosis.
- Racial disparities.
- Iodine concentration in food
- Radiation exposure.

Improvement of diagnostic accuracy of thyroid sonography may help to reduce the number of unnecessary Ô¨Åne-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB). The goal of the recent analysis of 502 thyroid nodules was the comparison of Ô¨Åve commonly used risk-stratiÔ¨Åcation systems: American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TIRADS), American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratiÔ¨Åcation, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (K-TIRADS) and European TIRADS (Eu-TIRADS). It was demonstrated that application of these systems resulted in the reduction of FNAB number by 17.1% up to 53.4%. The ACR TIRADS was characterized by the highest negative predictive value of 97.8%, with a false negative ratio of 2.2%. It allowed for the largest reduction of unnecessary FNABs (51).

Overtreatment does not result in better outcome?

- Patients overdiagnosed with thyroid cancer are harmed by:
    - Psycho-social aspect of cancer diagnosis,
    - Treatment applied,
    - Treatment-related consequences

QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS:

- hight rate bankruptcy in patient has cancer.
- Active surveillance:
    - Why has it  adopted : It has risen to limit the overtreatment, the related risk, and other important consequences.
    - Advantage:
        - prevent patient from unnecessary surgery and its complications.
        - Long life treatment.
        - Long life thyroid replacement therapy.
    - Disadvantage:
        - anxiety due to untreated malignancy or the possibility of non-compliance to
        follow-up protocol.

- Total thyroidectomy was chosen more frequently when the term PTC was used to name the condition, compared to using papillary lesion or abnormal cells, 19.6%, 10.5%, or 10.9%, respectively (95).
