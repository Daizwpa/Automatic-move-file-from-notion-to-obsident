Objective:

- Poor risk stratification of thyroid nodules by ultrasound has motivated the need for a deep learning-based approach for nodule segmentation. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of a multitask approach to detect ultrasounds containing potential nodules and segment nodules on the suspected images.
