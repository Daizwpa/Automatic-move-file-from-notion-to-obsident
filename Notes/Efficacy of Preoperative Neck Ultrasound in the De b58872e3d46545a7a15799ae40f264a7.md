Objectives/Hypothesis:

- **This study was performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of surgeon-performed preoperative neck ultrasound (US) in the detection of both central and lateral cervical lymph node metastases from thyroid cancer.**
- the goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of surgeon-performed preoperative neck US in detecting cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer.

Results:

- In all type of cancer, The sensitivity and specificity of The preoperative ultrasound assessment for Central Neck Compartment (Level VI) are 60% and 71.4%, respectively.
- In all types of cancer, The sensitivity and specificity of The preoperative ultrasound assessment for the lateral Neck compartment (level ll-V) are 68.3% and 94.8%, respectively.
- In Papillary thyroid carcinoma, the sensitivity and specificity of the preoperative ultrasound assessment for central neck compartment (level VI) are 64.3% and 61.1%, respectively.
- In papillary thyroid carcinoma, the sensitivity and specificity of the preoperative ultrasound assessment for lateral neck compartment (level II-V) are 76.5% and 94.1%, respectively.

Conclusion:

- Preoperative neck US is a valuable tool in assessing patients with thyroid cancers. The highly sensitive and specific nature of US in predicting cervical lymph node metastasis in the lateral neck, especially in the setting of recurrent disease, can provide reliable information to assist in surgical management. ***Although US for central compartment lymphadenopathy in the presence of the thyroid gland is less sensitive and specific than US for the lateral neck,*** it still provides useful information that can be obtained at the same time the primary thyroid pathology is assessed.
- **The difference in the sensitivity of neck US may be influenced by the expertise and the scope of the ultrasonographer.**
- Interpretation of US images is highly operator dependent. The head and neck surgeon has two advantages as an ultrasonographer: familiarity with
neck anatomy and knowledge of which surgical procedures the patient has previously undergone.

Quote:

- For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, cervical lymph node metastasis occurs in about 20% to 50% of patients.
- The incidence of micro metastasis approaches 90%, depending on the sensitivity of the method used for detection.
- Preoperative neck ultrasound has been shown to help identify suspicious cervical lymphadenopathy in 20% to 31% of cases.
- potentially altering the surgical management  strategy in 20% of patients. Thus, accurate preoperative staging is important for both determining the prognosis as well as tailoring surgical treatment strategies for patients with thyroid cancer.
