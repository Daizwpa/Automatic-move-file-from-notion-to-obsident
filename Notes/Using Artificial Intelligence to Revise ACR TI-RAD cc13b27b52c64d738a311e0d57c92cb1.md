Objective:

To use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS).

The aim of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms **to optimize TI-RADS feature point assignments.**

Task:

A total of 1425 biopsy-proven thyroid nodules from 1264 consecutive patients.

Expert readers assigned points based on five ACR TI-RADS categories (composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci).

create AI TI-RADS which is  genetic algorithm to derive an optimized and data-driven version of TI-RADS.

ACR TI-RADS compare with AI TI-RADS

Note:

**Risk stratification systems** for thyroid nodules are often complicated and affected by low specificity. Continual improvement of these systems is necessary to reduce the number of unnecessary thyroid biopsies.

 **Although most thyroid nodules are benign**, many patients are subjected to a costly workup that may include one or more biopsies, follow-up imaging, and even diagnostic lobectomy (3). **This contributes to the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancers that are not clinically significant (4).**

Over the past decade, multiple groups have developed biopsy guidelines for thyroid nodules based on their appearance at US, but some guidelines are difficult to apply and all lead to high false-positive rates (benign nodules for which biopsy is recommended).

The more suspicious the feature, the higher its point value. Points are summed to categorize a nodule into one of five TI-RADS risk levels, TR1 to TR5 (Table 1). Management recommendations are determined by using the risk level and the maximum size of the nodule.
