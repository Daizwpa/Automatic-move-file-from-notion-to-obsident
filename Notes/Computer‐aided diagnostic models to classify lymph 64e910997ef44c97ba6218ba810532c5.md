Objective:

- To construct two kinds of deep learning (DL)-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems including DL-convolutional neural networks (DL-CNN) and DL-machine learning for pathological diagnosis of cervical lymph nodes by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images.

Task:

- Collected CT, PET, and PET/CT images series from 165 patients with enlarged cervical lymph nodes receiving examinations from January 2014 to June 2018.
- Six CNNs pretrained on ImageNet as DL architectures were used for two kinds of DL-based CAD models, including DL-CNN and DL-machine learning models.
- The DL-CNN models were constructed via transfer learning for classification of lymphomatous and metastatic lymph nodes.
