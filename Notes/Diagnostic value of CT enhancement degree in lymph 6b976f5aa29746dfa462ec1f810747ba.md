Objective:

- To evaluate the value of computed tomography (CT) enhancement degree in diagnosing lymph node (LN) metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) by determining the ratio and difference between the Hounsﬁeld units (HU) of CT enhancement and plain scan of the LNs, as well as between the HU of CT-enhanced LNs and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
- In the present study, we propose for the first time comparative study of the LNs in one cervical level conﬁrmed to be all metastasis-positive or all metastasis-negative, and the metastasis-positive LNs determined by ﬁne-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) under US- CT fusion navigation.

Results:

- The diagnostic value of CT signs, such as **necrosis**, **cystic** degeneration, **microcalciﬁcation**, and signiﬁcant enhancement in PTC LN metastasis, has been widely recognized (2, 10, 11). Among
these signs, cystic degeneration has the highest speciﬁcity (96.3%–99.7%) in the judgment of LN metastasis in PTC but the lowest sensitivity (15.1%–24.3%); it was common in patients with extensive LN metastasis (10, 14).
- The speciﬁcity of microcalciﬁcation in judging PTC LN metastasis was second only to cystic degeneration, being about 78.5%–96.2%; its sensitivity was equal to or slightly higher than that of cystic degeneration, being about 21.5%–30.0% (10, 14).

Quotes:

- Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignant tumor of the thyroid, accounting for 83.6%–88% of cases (1, 2).
- Although the 5-year and 10-year survival rates of low-risk PTC are nearly 100% (3, 4), 20%–90% of patients with PTC have cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis at the time of diagnosis
(5), especially central LN metastasis.
- Metastatic LNs can invade the peripheral blood vessels, trachea, and esophagus, causing the
stenosis of the corresponding lumen, and invade the recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing hoarseness. Prophylactic LN dissection can reduce the residual metastatic LNs, but it is bound to increase the risk of the parathyroid gland and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (6).
- Typical ultrasound (US) images of LN metastasis often show signs such as LNs with transverse/long diameter > 0.5, blurred corticomedullary demarcation, disappearance of medullary structures, microcalciﬁcations, and cystic changes (7, 8).
- assessing LN metastasis in the lateral cervical levels, the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasonography diagnosis ranged 64%–74.3% and 70.0%–89.2%, respectively (9–13).
- in the assessment of LNs in the central levels, ultrasonography was often interfered with
by gases in the trachea and esophagus, as well as occlusion of the sternum and clavicle; also, the efﬁcacy of its assessment was not satisfactory, with the sensitivity and accuracy of 17.3%–38% and 58.5%–71%, respectively (9, 11–13).
- Compared with ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) examination is not limited by gas and bone and can better show the central level LNs. However, micro metastases in the cervical LNs of PTC are more common, and most of these LNs do not have typical CT metastasis
signs such as short diameter >1 cm, central necrosis or cystic degeneration, and microcalciﬁcations.
- **Besides, no accurate quantitative value is available for judging LN metastasis based on
the criterion of “the degree of enhancement is higher than that of muscle as a suspicious LN.” Therefore, the sensitivity and accuracy of the CT examination are not superior to those of US, with 23.5%–50% and 55.7%–75%, respectively (11-13).**
- US-CT fusion navigation is the registration and fusion of US and CT images, which integrates the advantages of high resolution and high detection rate of CT and real-time guidance of US.
