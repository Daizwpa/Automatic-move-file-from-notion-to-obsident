Quotes:

- The thyroid gland can have variable CT scan findings, such as calcifications, single or multiple nodules, cysts, or diffuse enlargement.
- Calcified nodules had a significantly higher incidence of thyroid cancer and lymph node metastases.
- The absence of these features does not exclude malignant tumours, especially papillary, follicular, and medullary thyroid carcinomas (Fig. 3) [1].
