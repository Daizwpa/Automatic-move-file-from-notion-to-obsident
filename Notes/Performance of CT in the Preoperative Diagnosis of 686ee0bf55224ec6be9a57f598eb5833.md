Objective:

- Ultrasound has become widely accepted as the ﬁrst imaging technique used for the assessment of cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. **In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluate the performance of CT for the preoperative diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid cancer compared with ultrasound.**

Conclusion:

- The diagnostic performances of CT and ultrasound are similar, though CT and ultrasound combined are superior to ultrasound only. CT may be used as a complementary diagnostic method in addition to ultrasound for diagnosing cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid cancer.
- **CT is a standardized, objective imaging technique that is less operator-dependent com-
pared with US.**
- CT provides detailed axial anatomic information systematically from the base of the skull to the mediastinum, which is familiar to most thyroid surgeons.
- CT can evaluate lymph nodes in the retropharyngeal, retrosternal, and mediastinal areas.20
- As the new American Thyroid Association guidelines suggest, CT can also be useful for evaluating the tumor extent involving the larynx, trachea, or esophagus as well as showing extranodal extension involving surrounding critical structures.7
- Our meta-analysis revealed that the summary sensitivity of combined CT/US (69%) was significantly higher than that of US (51%) (P ⫽ .011). This improved sensitivity of combined CT/US allows better surgical planning and a better chance for removing all suspected cervical lymph node metastasis during surgery.
- Therefore, we believe that combined CT/US may have a supportive role, especially for preoperative surgical planning in patients with suspected lymph node metastasis or a high-risk of lymph node metastasis.16,23

- The use of **iodine-based contrast materials** was strongly restricted before the operation due to the concern for disturbed radioactive iodine uptake for months and the delay of radioiodine
treatment.36 **Therefore, contrast-enhanced CT has not been recommended for the preoperative** diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis. However, several recent studies have reported the supposition that the delay of radioiodine therapy was not necessary in patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT because the iodine is generally cleared within 4–8 weeks in most patients, and the body iodine content is not an essential determinant of thyroid ablation.37-41 Therefore, the benefit gained from improved anatomic imaging generally outweighs any potential risk regarding a several-week delay in radioactive iodine imaging or therapy.

Quote:

- A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the sensitivity of US was 63% (95% CI, 47%–76%), the specificity was 93% (95% CI, 73%–99%), and the area under the curve was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77–0.84) by level-by-level analysis.8
- However, because US is an operator-dependent technique, it is often difficult to evaluate the entire neck. Several US studies have reported variable and relatively low sensitivity for the assessment of central cervical lymph node metastasis.9-11 Normal anatomic structures, including the larynx, trachea, and areas deep in the clavicles, jaw, and sternum, cause significant acoustic shadowing.12 This results in limited US evaluation of the mediastinum and retropharyngeal area, regardless of clinical experience of the operator.

- Preoperative knowledge of these features of the primary tumor or metastases could significantly influence the surgical plan.7,23
- Therefore, it is timely and necessary to collect currently available data regarding the diagnostic performance of CT in the preoperative diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis.
