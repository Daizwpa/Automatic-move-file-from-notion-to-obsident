Note:

The past 5–10 years have brought in a new era in the care of patients with thyroid cancer, with the introduction of transformative diagnostic and management options.  **Several international ultrasound-based thyroid nodule risk stratification systems have been developed with the goal of reducing unnecessary biopsies.**

Based on the GLOBOCAN 2020 database of cancer incidence and mortality by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer, thyroid cancer has **the ninth highest cancer incidence worldwide**.1,2

Thyroid cancer is categorised into three broad histological categories:

 (1) **differentiated thyroid cancer,** which includes papillary, follicular, and oncocytic thyroid carcinoma.

 (2) **medullary thyroid cancer, which is sometimes associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndromes.**

(3) **anaplastic thyroid cancer, which often arises from differentiated thyroid cancer and has a high mortality.**

the past 40 years, there has been a rise in thyroid cancer incidence globally, 

which has disproportionately affected women and has been more prominent in some countries (eg, South Korea) than others.

2,8–10 **Many studies have shown that this observed worldwide increase in thyroid cancer incidence is largely driven by increased detection of small, low-risk papillary thyroid cancer, which has occurred due to greater use of thyroid ultrasonography.8–14**

**Ultrasound is the recommended initial imaging modality to assess palpable thyroid nodules** or thyroid nodules documented by other imaging techniques. 

**Ultrasound is extremely sensitive in identifying the number and characteristics of thyroid nodules, and high-risk features associated with greater risk of malignancy, such as irregular margins, punctate echogenic foci, and extrathyroidal extension.18**

Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a real issue, with real harms (eg, unnecessary surgery with potential
complications, personal and societal costs of treatment,19 psychological effects of a cancer diagnosis, and decreased quality of life after cancer diagnosis),20,21 clinicians should strive to avoid overdiagnosis. This balance is difficult to achieve because not all patients with progressive, metastatic thyroid cancer have palpable thyroid nodules, and not all diagnoses of the lowest-risk thyroid cancers are avoidable.

Several international risk stratification systems have been developed that use 
nodules to determine malignancy risk, and make recommendations about which nodules to evaluate further with FNA.

the American Thyroid Association, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging and Reporting And Data System (ACR TI-RADS), the European Thyroid Imaging and Reporting Data System (EU-TIRADS), and the revised Korean

Globally, thyroid cancer incidence rates are five times greater in high and very high Human Development Index countries than in low and medium Human Development Index countries, with mortality rates similar.² However, beyond comparing incidence and mortality rates, there has not been an in-depth analysis of between-country disparities in thyroid care.

**Management of differentiated thyroid cancer For all patients, the initial management of differentiated
thyroid cancer should be guided by the pre-treatment risk assessment, which includes physical examination, ultrasound assessment, and cytological interpretation**. Unnecessary or too invasive treatment should be avoided. Initial management options, from least to most invasive, include active surveillance, minimally invasive interventions, and surgery. In some patients, additional treatment with radioactive iodine, thyroid hormone suppression, and systemic therapies might be appropriate. Initial management options for papillary thyroid cancer, the most common thyroid cancer type, based on tumour characteristics, are shown in figure 3.
