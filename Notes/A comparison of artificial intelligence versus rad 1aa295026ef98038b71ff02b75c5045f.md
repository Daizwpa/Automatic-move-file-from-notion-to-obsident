Objective:

- The primary objective of this study was to accumulate the pooled sensitivity and specificity between all available AI and radiologists using thyroid US imaging.
- The secondary objective was to compare AI’s diagnostic performance to that of radiologists.

Task:

- PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception until June 11, 2020.
- Apply Eligibility criteria for the founded articles to select more relevant articles.
- assessment quality of articles using :
    - QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy [6]
    - Four domains of evaluation were used: patient selection, index test, reference standard, flow and timing
- Statistical analysis:
    - The pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity with 95% confidence interval (CI) of both AI and radiologists were calculated using a bivariate random effect model as shown in the forest plot.
    - Diagnostic performance was compared between the two groups using Diagnostic Odd Ratio (DOR) and accuracy was determined using AUC.
    - Publication bias was assessed using Deek’s Funnel Plot Asymmetry Test [7].
    - Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and Cochran’s Q test.
    - used meta-regression and subgroup analysis to identify the cause of heterogeneity. Data were analyzed using STATA version 15.1.

Results:

- Twenty five studies were included in this meta-analysis.
- The pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI were 0.86 (95% CI 0.81–0.91) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.73 0.83), respectively.
- The pooled sensitivity and specificity of radiologists were 0.85 (95% CI 0.80–0.89) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.77–0.86), respectively.
- The accuracy of AI and radiologists is equivalent in terms of AUC [AI 0.89 (95% CI 0.86–0.92), radiologist 0.91 (95% CI 0.88–0.93)].
- The diagnostic odd ratio (DOR) between AI 23.10 (95% CI 14.20–37.58) and radiologists 27.12 (95% CI 17.45–42.16) had no statistically significant difference (P = 0.56).
- Meta-regression analysis revealed that Deep Learning AI had significantly greater sensitivity and specificity than classic machine learning AI (P < 0.001).

Conclusion:

- **AI demonstrated comparable performance to radiologists in the diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules regards to US.**
- Deep learning-based AI is likely to outperform classic machine learning-based AI.
- Although the application of AI is promising, relying solely on AI may be limited and should be used with caution in clinical practice.

Quotes:

- The prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules in the general population ranges between 2 and 6%.
- Non-palpable nodules diagnosed by ultrasonography (US) have a higher prevalence of 19–35% [1] and can reach to 68% when using high resolution US [2].
- Malignancy is present in only 7–15% of all nodules regardless of size.
- Currently, US is the first investigation in the management of thyroid nodules and determines whether fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is required to differentiate malignant from benign nodules [4].
- Ultrasonography (US) is well documented to be operator-dependent [5]. As a result, inexperienced radiologists, and an overwhelming workload in a short period of time may contribute to errors, resulting in unnecessary FNA and anxiety for patients.
