Status: In progress
Type of paper: Meta-analysis review, systematic review

Objective:

- Radiomics is a ﬁeld that uses radiological features to inform individualized patient care. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of radiomics in classifying undetermined thyroid nodules into benign and malignant using ultrasonography (US).

Results:

- Radiomics provided a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86–0.87) and a pooled speciﬁcity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.84–0.85) for characterizing benign and malignant lesions.
- Using convolutional neural network (CNN) methods, pooled sensitivity was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.84–0.86) and pooled speciﬁcity was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.82–0.83); signiﬁcantly lower than studies using non-CNN: sensitivity 0.90 (95% CI: 0.89–0.90) and speciﬁcity 0.88 (95% CI: 0.87–0.89) (p < 0.05)
- The diagnostic ability of radiologists and radiomics were comparable for both sensitivity (OR 0.98) and speciﬁcity (OR 0.95).

Conclusions:

- Radiomic analysis using US provides a reproducible, reliable evaluation of undetermined thyroid nodules when compared to current best practice.
- Radiomic analyses demonstrate equal diagnostic sensitivity and speciﬁcity of identifying malignant lesions when compared to radiologists.
- Within the ﬁeld of radiomics, at present, non-CNN methods may be considered the preferred radiomic means of classifying thyroid nodules.

Quotes:

- These systems classify lesions on a scale ranging from benign to malignant based on sonographic parameters such as size, echogenicity, degree of margin irregularity, nodule height to width ratio, extra nodular extension, and calciﬁcation [4,5,7].
- Suspicious nodules then proceed to ﬁne-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), where they are reassessed and graded as non-diagnostic, benign, atypical, suspicious for malignancy, or deﬁnitively malignant, using cytological reporting systems such as the Bethesda or Thy classiﬁcation systems [8,9].
- At present, patients with undetermined nodules following FNAC undergo surgery in order to obtain a deﬁnitive histological diagnosis, with 95% of nodules subsequently being stratiﬁed as “benign” [10], leading to the conceptualization that the present paradigm is guilty of overexposing patients to unnecessary over-investigation and overtreatment. Thus, it is vital for translational research efforts to focus on means of accurately screening and sub stratifying detected thyroid nodules into benign and malignant categories [11].
- It represents a quantitative approach to medical imaging through mathematical extraction of the spatial distribution of signal intensities and pixel interrelationships, quantifying textural information by using AI analysis methods.
- For some patients, the use of radiomics could possibly circumvent the need for FNAC and surgical resection, providing a potentially more cost and time-efﬁcient assessment of thyroid nodules than what is currently practiced [20,94].
