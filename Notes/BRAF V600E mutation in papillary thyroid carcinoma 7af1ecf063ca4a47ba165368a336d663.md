Objective:

- This study focuses on the oncologic influence of BRAF V600E mutations in
a cohort of Middle Eastern papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients treated at a
single centre. We tested the association of BRAF V600E mutation with papillary thyroid carcinoma at King Hussein Cancer Center.

Results:

- The tumour size for patients with a negative BRAF V600E mutation was significantly larger in comparison to patients who tested positive for the mutation (3.47 cm vs 2.31 cm, respectively, P = 0.009)
- 

Conclusion:

- BRAF V600E mutation had no effect on loco-regional recurrence, distant
metastasis, overall survival, or DFS. These findings may be attributed to geographic
variations or reflect that BRAF V600E may only serve as an indicator of poor prognosis in  high-risk group as such.
- **The overall significance of BRAF mutation in PTC is unclear. In addition, the incidence and clinical impact of BRAF V600E mutation among PTC patients from Middle Eastern races remain unknown.**
- These findings, in adjunct with our results, may justify that although BRAF V600E mutation may play a role in local development of the tumour, it does not always predict aggressive characteristics and poor prognosis.
