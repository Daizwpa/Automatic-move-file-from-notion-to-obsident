Objective:

- the present study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects between histologic subtype, tumor size, lymph node metastasis (LNM) status and extrathyroidal extension (ETE) on the incidence of DM in DTC.

Results:

- The presence of ETE and FTC, ETE and large tumor size or ETE and LNM may have a synergistic effect of increasing the risk on DM in patients with DTC.
- The results of the univariate analysis (Table II) revealed that patients with DTC with large tumor size (>10 mm; P<0.001), ETE (P<0.001) or LNM (P<0.001) were more likely to develop DM.
- The synergistic effects of histologic subtype, tumor size, ETE and LNM status on DM might benefit cancer  management; if two of the four variables are present, this may suggest that the patients with DTC may be more likely to exhibit DM, which is difficult to diagnose at an early stage. Thus, aggressive treatment may be recommended, such as surgical treatment, thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, radioiodine, molecular targeted or biological therapy (4,5).

Conclusion:

- the results of this study revealed that ETE with follicular thyroid histology, N1 stage or large tumor size may have a synergistic effect on the risk of DM in patients with DTC.
- These results suggested that individualized treatment may benefit patients with DTC, and when ETE coexists with one of the identified risk factors, radical treatments may be required.
- The preliminary analyses of the present study demonstrated that patients with FTC and ETE obtained the highest incidence of DM compared with the other subgroups (patients with
FTC and ETE, patients with FTC without ETE, and patients with PTC and ETE).
- The presence of ETE and FTC, ETE and large tumor size or ETE and LNM may have
a synergistic effect of increasing the risk on DM in patients with DTC.

Quote:

- Multiple treatments are applied for DTC, including surgical treatment, thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, radioiodine, molecular-targeted radiation and biological therapy (4,5).
- The development of individualized, dynamic clinical treatment has greatly improved the survival rate of patients with DTC, with the 10-year survival rate reaching 90% in U.S over the past 40 years, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual (8th edition) (6).
- A high percentage of mortality from DTC is associated with distant metastasis (DM), which is identified at diagnosis in 2-5% of patients with DTC (8,9).
- The lung parenchyma is the most common site of DM, followed by the bone, brain, liver, kidney and skin (10,11).
- Therefore, the detection of DM in patients with DTC at an early stage is important for further improving the survival rate.
- Lymph node metastasis (LNM) status and tumor size are also associated with DM in patients with PTC (16,17).
- Previous studies have also identified ETE and LNM status as independent risk factors for DM in patients with DTC (18-20).
- Previous studies have indicated that LNM, tumor size, histologic subtype and ETE are risk factors that influence the prognosis of patients with DTC (20,28,29).
