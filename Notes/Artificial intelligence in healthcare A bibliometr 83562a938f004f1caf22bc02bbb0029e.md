**Applying AI in health care can beneﬁt physicians, patients, and healthcare providers in four ways:** 

**i.** estimating the chances of treatment success and analyzing disease onset before treatment initiation;

ii. by preventing or managing complications; 

iii. actively supporting patient care during diagnosis and/or treatment, 

iv. by identifying the pathology of the disease, and also the best treatment [9] .
