Quotes:

- The occurrence and development of cancer is a slow and complicated process, which is closely related to the bidirectional interactions between cancer cells and their environment, forming the tumor microenvironment (TME).
- The tumor microenvironment TME is a complex mixture composed of **cancer cells**, **stromal cells**, **immune cells**, **stem cells**, **tumor-associated fibroblasts** (TAF), **non-cellular components within extracellular matrix (ECM)**, etc., and plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis, growth, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and the therapeutic efficacy of cancer.
