Objective:

- This study aims to evaluate outcomes and **to define independent variables that are associated**
**with tumor-related mortality in patients with distant metastasis from thyroid carcinoma.**

What things do they analysed:

- **Patient**, **tumor**, and **treatment-related factors** were **analyzed for their relation to disease-specific survival (DSS)** using multivariate Cox regression and the log-rank test.

Results:

- Median survival was 4.1 years
- 10-year DSS was 26%.
- Distant disease was synchronous with the primary diagnosis in 97 of242 (40%) patients.
- The site of metastasis was lung only in 103 (43%) patients, bone only in 80 (33%), other sites in 14 (6%), and more than one organ system in 45 (19%).
- Multivariate analysis identified age 45 years or more, symptoms, site other than lung only or bone only, and no radioactive iodine treatment for the metastasis as predictors of poor outcome with 13%, 11%, 16%, and 12% 10-year DSS, respectively.
- This compares with age less than 45 years, asymptomatic presentation, metastasis only in the lung or bone, and radioactive iodine treatment with 10-year DSS rates of 58%, 45%, 32%, and 33%, respectively

Conclusion:

- Long term survival is possible in patients with distant metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancer.
- This retrospective study found that age of45 years or more, site other than lung only or bone only, and symptoms at the time of diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes.
- Patients with either bone only or lung only metastasis had an improved survival compared with other sites with more than one site.
- Based on univariate analysis, previous reports have identified bone metastasis and multisite disease as associated with decreased 10-year survival [2-5 ] as compared with lung metastasis.
- In the current study, patients with bone metastasis tended toward improved 10-year DSS when the disease was metachronous and patients with lung metastasis tended to have improved survival if the disease was synchronous with the primary thyroid cancer.

Quotes:

- metastatic disease develops in 7% to 23% of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [1-5] and another 1% to 4% present with distant disease at the time of initial diagnosis.
- an estimated 1,300 patients succumbed to metastatic thyroid cancer in the year 2001. [9]
- Long term survival rates after diagnosis of metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer range from 13% to 100%.
