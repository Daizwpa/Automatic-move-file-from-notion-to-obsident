- The gold standard for assessing LNM is based on lymph node biopsy or pathologic histologic examination after surgical lymph node dissection. However, such invasive methods often have certain adverse reactions, and patients without LNM can be checked excessively ([10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9346219/#r10),[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9346219/#r11)). Ultrasound (US) is a non-invasive and inexpensive technique that can be used to differentiate between benign and metastatic nodes ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9346219/#r12)).
- However, the conventional US diagnostic criteria for malignant lymph nodes are still controversial, with low sensitivity and specificity ([13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9346219/#r13)). US imaging is operator dependent, and retropharyngeal, retrosternal, and mediastinum evaluations can be difficult ([14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9346219/#r14)-[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9346219/#r16)). I**n contrast, computed tomography (CT) is a relatively objective imaging method. It has good spatial resolution, is not affected by the trachea or sternum, and is operator independent. CT can provide detailed, objective anatomic information with unlimited coverage, even to deep areas ([16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9346219/#r16),[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9346219/#r17)).**
