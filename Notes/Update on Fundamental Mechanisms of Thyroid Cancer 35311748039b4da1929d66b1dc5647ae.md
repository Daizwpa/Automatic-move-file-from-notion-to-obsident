Objective:

- This review **discusses the molecular mechanisms associated to the pathogenesis of different types of TC and their clinical relevance.**

Conclusion:

- We discussed  the molecular mechanisms involved into the pathogenesis of the different types of TC and their clinical relevance.
- In the last years, many steps forward have been made in the genetic characterization of TC, providing molecular markers for diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment targets.
- Many other steps need to be done in order to diagnose TCs with aggressive behavior, to tailor the most appropriate target therapy, and to monitor the response to the therapies using new molecular approaches.

Quotes:

- In the last years, progresses in the genetic characterization of TC have provided molecular markers for **diagnosis**, **risk stratification**, and **treatment targets.**
- Recently, papillary TC, the most frequent form of TC, has been reclassified into two **molecular subtypes**, named **BRAF-like** and **RAS-like**, associated to a different range of cancer risks.

- Histological type of thyroid cancer:
    - Differentiated TC, accounting for more than 90% of thyroid malignancies, comprises papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC).
    - Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) are rare tumors (5 and 1%, respectively) associated with aggressive behavior and short median time of survival (5 years and 6 months, respectively).
    - Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), representing 5% of TC, arises from parafollicular C cells.
</aside>

- **TC** is a genetically simple disease with a **relatively low somatic mutation burden in each tumor**.
- Driver mutations, i.e., mutations that provide a selective growth advantage thus promoting cancer development, are identified in more than 90% of TC (4).
- **The molecular pathogenesis of the majority of TC involves dysregulation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways**

- These genetic alterations are common in PTC, leading to (constitutively) activation of MAPK or PI3K signaling pathways (19).
- RET proto-oncogene encodes for a tyrosine kinase receptor.

- Mitogen-active protein kinase MAPK activation is consider to be a crucial for Papillary Thyroid cancer through point mutations of:
    - BARF.
    - RAS.
    - RET/PTC.
    - TRK.

ü´†

- PI3K/AKT activation is thought to be critical in FTC initiation and can be triggered by activating mutations:
    - RAS.
    - PIK3CA.
    - AKT1.
    
    as well as by inactivating: PTEN

- TC progression and dediÔ¨Äerentiation to PDTC and ATC involves a number of additional mutations aÔ¨Äecting other cell signaling pathways, such as p53 and Wnt/Œ≤-catenin.

- More recently, TERT promoter mutations have been described in all the histological TC type, with a signiÔ¨Åcantly higher prevalence in aggressive and undiÔ¨Äerentiated tumors, indicating their role in TC progression (Figure 1).

> PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA:
> 
> - **The clinical challenge relies** in the early identiÔ¨Åcation of those patients who need aggressive treatment from the beginning from those who will have an indolent course.
> - RET rearrangements or point mutations of RAS or BRAF proto-oncogenes have been described and are found in an almost mutually exclusive modality in nearly 70% of PTC (Table 1). These genetic alterations are common in PTC, leading to (constitutively) activation of MAPK or PI3K signaling pathways (19).

> - RET proto-oncogene mutation:
>     - RET/PTC fusion protein maintains the tyrosine kinase domain
>     intact and enables uncontrolled activation of the MAPK signaling
>     cascade (20).
>     - RET rearrangement was Ô¨Årst reported by Fusco et al. (21), and in the following years, diÔ¨Äerent types of RET/PTC rearrangements have been identiÔ¨Åed (15).
>     - RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 are the most common (5).
>     - The prevalence of RET rearrangements in PTC has varied deeply among studies (2.5‚Äì73%) (22, 23) probably due to ethnical and geographical variations as well as to the method used for their identiÔ¨Åcation and genetic heterogeneity, as demonstrated by Zhu et al. (24);
>     - recent reports, however, from the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in a series of 484 PTC belonging to diÔ¨Äerent ethnic groups, only 6.8%presented RET rearrangements.
>     - Some reports have indicated RET/PTC1 as being associated with a more favorable prognosis, while RET/PTC3 was associated with a more aggressive and malignant phenotype (25, 26).
>     - Patients harboring these rearrangements usually follow a favorable course, owing to their ability to respond well to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy (27).

> - BRAF Mutation:
>     - BRAF has been shown to be mutated and constitutively activated in ‚àº7% of all cancers.
>     - Prevalence of BRAF mutation in PTC varies among diÔ¨Äerent series ranging from 29 to 83% (30‚Äì37).
>     - the TCGA reported 74.6% of BRAF mutations in PTC, of which 61.7% were V600E substitutions.
>     - DiÔ¨Äerent genetic alterations have been identiÔ¨Åed in this gene; however, the majority of classic PTC (cPTC) harbor the BRAFV600E variant (32).

> - RAS Mutation:
>     - RAS protein acts through the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways.
>     - Missense mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 lead to constitutive activation of RAS signaling, which is found mutated in >30% of all tumors, including thyroid lesions both benign and malignant (43).
>     - In fact, RAS mutations may be found in FTC (28‚Äì68%), in follicular-variant PTC [FVPTC; up to 43% (31)], and in its non-invasive FVPTC [NIFTP; up to 47% (44)], as well as in follicular adenomas (20‚Äì25%) (45), showing the limited role for
>     RAS mutations alone in the clinical outcomes of TC (5, 46).
