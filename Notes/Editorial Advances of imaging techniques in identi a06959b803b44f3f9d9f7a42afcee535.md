**TNs patients are diagnosed by** history taking and physical examination, ultrasonography, Thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) serum measurement, ﬁne needle aspiration, and scintigraphy (4).

Most TNs proved benign; however, **7 to 15% of TNs are malignant, causing mortality if not treated properly (5, 6**). Hence, diagnostic tools are most necessary to differentiate benign and malignant TNs to provide optimal treatment.

**the US remains the conservative diagnostic modality of TNs malignancy,** especially in areas with limited healthcare facilities (5).

summary:

in this editorial they talked about  three search areas related:

- Artiﬁcial intelligence prediction models compared to real-world evidence.
- Advanced ultrasonography from grey-scale to contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.
- Ultrasonography (US) characterization for TNs and lymph node metastasis.
