Status: Not started
Task: Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis, Review
Type of paper: Meta-analysis review, systematic review

Objective:

- We aimed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of CT and MRI in detecting cervical lymph node metastasis, and to establish unified diagnostic criteria via systematic review and meta-analysis

Method:

Results:

- The pooled results of meta-analysis showed that:
    - CT had a higher SEN (0.77 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.73–0.87]) than MRI (0.72 [95% CI 0.70–0.74]) when node was considered as unit of analysis (P<0.05);
    - MRI had a higher SPE (0.81 [95% CI 0.80–0.82]) than CT (0.72 [95% CI 0.69–0.74]) when neck level was considered as unit of analysis (P<0.05)
    - MRI had a higher area under concentration-time curve than CT when the patient was considered as unit of analysis (P<0.05).
    - With regards to diagnostic criteria, for MRI, the results showed that the minimal axial diameter of 10 mm could be considered as the best size criterion, compared to 12 mm for CT.

Conclusion:

- Overall, MRI conferred significantly higher SPE while CT demonstrated higher SEN. The diagnostic criteria for MRI and CT on size of metastatic lymph nodes were suggested as 10 and 12 mm, respectively.

Quote:

- Many imaging techniques exist for identifying cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with head and neck cancers.9–12
- usually the cervical lymph nodes demonstrate similar density as muscle on pre-contrast images of CT examination, and they can be separated from adjacent vessels by their differential enhancement after contrast administration.15
- The accurate detection of the cervical lymph node metastasis is thus very important.91,92 Clinical palpation used to be the method to detect cervical nodal metastasis before the development of imaging technologies. However, studies have shown that both the SEN and the SPE of this technique were unsatisfactory, with a high false positive rate of 25%–51%.
- The improvements in imaging technologies may make it possible for cervical lymph nodes metastasis in head and neck cancer patients can be effectively diagnosed, especially with CT and MRI.11,12,93–96 However, under current health care settings usually only one imaging technique will be performed. Thus a systematic evaluation regarding whether one of the two imaging techniques (CT and MRI) can have a better efficacy than the other will be critical to better guide the clinical practices
