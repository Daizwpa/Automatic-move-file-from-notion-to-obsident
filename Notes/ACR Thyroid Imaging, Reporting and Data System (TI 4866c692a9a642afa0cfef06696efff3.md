Objective:

- In this article, the authors present the ACR TI-RADS Committee’s recommendations, which provide guidance regarding management of thyroid nodules on the basis of their ultrasound appearance. The authors also describe the committee’s future directions.

Result:

Conclusion:

- The committee believes that the ACR TI-RADS meets our stated goals, although acknowledging the limitations of our additive approach, which does not fully account for the possibility that the risk conferred by a given ultrasound feature may vary depending on what other features are present in a nodule. As well, several committee members have embarked on a parallel project in which interobserver variability of ultrasound feature assignment will be measured. We plan to revise the ACR TI-RADS periodically as results from this study and other evidence comes to light.

Quote:

- Thyroid nodules are a frequent ﬁnding on neck sonography. Most nodules are benign; therefore, many nodules are biopsied to identify the small number that are malignant or require surgery for a deﬁnitive diagnosis.
- many professional societies and investigators have proposed ultrasound-based risk stratiﬁcation systems to identify nodules that warrant biopsy or sonographic follow-up.
- most nodules are benign, and even malignant nodules, particularly ones smaller than 1 cm, frequently exhibit indolent or nonaggressive behavior [3-5]. Therefore, not all detected nodules require FNA and/or surgery.
- In the United States, overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer, deﬁned as “diagnosis of thyroid tumors that would not, if left alone, result in symptoms or death” accounted for 70% to 80% of thyroid cancer cases in women and 45% of cases in men between 2003 and 2007 [7].
