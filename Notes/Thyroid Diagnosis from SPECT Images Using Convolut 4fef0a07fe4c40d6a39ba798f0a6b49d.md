Objective:

- Develop computer-aided diagnosis of thyroid diseases.

Contribution:

- Ô¨Årst, the paper introduces the deep learning method into the diagnosis of thyroid disease based on SPECT images.
- the paper has improved the existing deep learning network DenseNet from both the network architecture and the training method, which makes the diagnostic eÔ¨Äect of the deep learning method greatly improved compared with other deep learning methods.

Task:

- 

Quotes:

- **There is little research on the application of SPECT images in the computer-aided diagnosis of thyroid diseases based on machine learning methods.**
