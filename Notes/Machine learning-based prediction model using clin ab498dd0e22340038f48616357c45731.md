Objective:

- To analysed the prognostic significance of clinico-pathologic factors.
- To construct a disease recurrence prediction model using machine
learning techniques.

Task:

- retrospectively analysed clinico-pathologic data from 1040 patients diagnosed with PTC between 2003 and 2009.
- analysed clinico-pathologic factors related to recurrence through logistic regression analysis
