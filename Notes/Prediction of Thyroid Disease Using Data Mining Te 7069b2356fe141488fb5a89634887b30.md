Objective:

- The current study refers to thyroid disease classification in two of the most common thyroid dysfunctions (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism) among the population. The authors analyzed and compared four classification models: Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function Network.
