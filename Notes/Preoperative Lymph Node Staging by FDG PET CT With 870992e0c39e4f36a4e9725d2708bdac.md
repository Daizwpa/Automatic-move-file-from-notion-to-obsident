Objective:

- he purpose of this study was to compare lymph node (LN) staging using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with contrast-enhancement (CE) PET/CT and contrast enhanced neck CT (neck CT) in patients with thyroid cancer with level-by-level comparison with various factors.

Method:

Results:

Conclusion:

- Contrast enhanced PET/CT was more sensitive and reliable than neck CT for preoperative LN staging in patients with thyroid cancer.
