Objective:

- The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of preoperative [18F]Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/Computed to mography (PET/CT) by comparing it to neck sonography in papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Method:

Results:

- Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed lower sensitivity and higher specificity than sonography for detection of cervical node metastasis;  however, no statistically significant difference was noted (P > .99). Only the tumor size was associated with FDG uptake in the primary tumor.
- 

Conclusion:

- [18F] Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT could not provide additional information compared to neck sonography.
