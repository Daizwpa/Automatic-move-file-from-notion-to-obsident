Quotes:

- Thyroid carcinomas develop from two different cell types in the thyroid gland:
    - follicular cells and parafollicular (C) cells. Follicular cells are epithelial cells that are responsible for iodine uptake and thyroid hormone synthesis (Colin et al. 2013), and from which arise >90% of thyroid-derived carcinomas.
    - Parafollicular (C) cells produce and secrete the hormone calcitonin and generate 3 5% of thyroid-derived carcinomas, collectively known as medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC), which are predominantly driven by activating mutations in the RET (rearranged during transfection) tyrosine kinase receptor (Cote et al. 2015).

- Carcinomas derived from thyroid follicular cells can be subdivided into four main different types based on histological architecture and cellular morphology.
    - Thyroid carcinomas that retain differentiated properties are termed well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTC) and include two main subtypes:
        - papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
        - follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC).
    - The two other main types are:
        - poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC).
        - anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC).
- ATC is generally  accepted that it derives from accumulating mutations in pre-existing Well differentiation thyroid cancer, with poorly differentiation thyroid cancer likely being intermediate state in its progression (Wiseman et al. 2003a,b, Landa et al. 2016).
- The nature of these essential pathways is highly complex, with hundreds of components, multiple points of crosstalk, different subcellular localizations and with the ability to potentially regulate many cellular processes.
- The MAPK pathway is a conserved signal-transduction pathway that utilizes a series of protein kinases to transmit signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus.
- Hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway is implicated in various pathologies, including neurodegenerative and developmental diseases, diabetes and cancer (Krishna & Narang 2008).

- PTC can be classified into several variants, among the common of which are the classic variant (CV-PTC), the follicular variant (FV-PTC) and the tall cell variant (TCV-PTC).
- PTC is mostly related to mutations that activate the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway, such as RET, NTRK (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene rearrangements or RAS (rat sarcoma) and BRAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma type-B) activating point mutations, which are almost always found in an exclusive manner, suggesting that oncogenic activation of one member of the pathway is sufficient to drive transformation (Kimura et al. 2003, Soares et al. 2003, Frattini et al. 2004).
