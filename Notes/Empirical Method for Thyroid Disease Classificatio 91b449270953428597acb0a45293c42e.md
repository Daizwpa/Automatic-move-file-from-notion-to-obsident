# The objective:

In this paper, various machine learning algorithms like decision tree, random forest algorithm, KNN, and artiﬁcial neural networks on the dataset create a comparative analysis to better predict the disease based on parameters established from the dataset. Also, the dataset has been manipulated for accurate prediction for the classiﬁcation

The proposed framework will take input in the form of dataset and then forward to the pre-processing module. In the pre-processing module, the normalization of images is per-formed in this module. After pre-processing the images, augmentation is performed. In augmentation, the dataset is divided into two parts: the training dataset and the testing dataset. After the augmentation process, import AlexNet and compare it with the customized AlexNet, and meet the criteria and store it in a trained model as shown in Figure 1.

The classiﬁcation will contain two classes. Class 0 is negative, and class 1 is positive. Normal means that the patient is not suﬀering from thyroid disease.

The applied models:

K-nearest, ANN, naïve bayes, random forest.

# The result:

we obtained the highest accuracy for the random forest algorithm, equal to 94.8% accuracy
and 91% speciﬁcity.
