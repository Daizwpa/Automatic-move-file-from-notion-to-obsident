Objective:

- to investigate the association between lymph node (N) stage and clinical outcome in thyroid cancer patients with initial distant metastasis.

Quote:

- PTC and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) are classified as differentiated TCs that both arise from thyroid follicular cells and generally have excellent prognoses.
- the poorly differentiated thyroid cancers have a poorer prognosis which probably arises from either PTCs or FTCs.
- Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) has been derived from the parafollicular C cells, accounting for about 1-2% of TCs ([**5**](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2020.00090/full#B5)).
- Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) originates from follicular cells and is an aggressive, undifferentiated, and rapidly fatal tumor ([**6**](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2020.00090/full#B6)).
