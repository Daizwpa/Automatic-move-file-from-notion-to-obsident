Muti-central Data: True
Number Of Patient: 38772
Type of paper: Experimental article, Statistical analysis
Data Region : Korea

Objective:

- In the present study, the clinico-pathological findings and treatment outcomes of unusual metastases in differentiated thyroid cancer patients in Korea were evaluated.
- analysis :
    - The pathological findings of primary thyroid cancer.
    - Diagnostic method for unusual metastases.
    - Treatment responses of unusual metastases

Tools used to diagnosis Distant metastasis:

- Fine needle aspiration.
- Biopsy.
- fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography
- fluorodeoxyglucose F 18  computed tomography
- iodine 131 whole body scans with simultaneously elevated serum levels of thyroglobulin.

Therapeutic modalities included:

- Radioactive iodine ablation therapy for RAI avid lesions.
- radiofrequency ablation.
- surgery.
- systemic chemotherapy.
- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
- 

Database baseline:

patients: 38 772 DTC

distant metastasis patient : 

- 442 usual distant metastases (1.1%) in 392 patients (321 cases of lung metastases, 105 cases of bone metastases, and 16 cases of brain metastases)
- 25 Unusual metastasis (0.06%) in 19 patients were observed.

**Pathological diagnostic approach for Unusual metastasis:**

- unusual metastasis of 10 patients (52.6%) were pathologically diagnosed based on cytological or histological results.
- One patient with pancreatic head metastasis was diagnosed using endoscopic US (EUS)-guided FNA.
- Other patient with pancreatic body and tail metastases was diagnosed using CT-guided FNA.
- Diagnostic surgery was performed for ovary metastasis (n = 1)
- The histological diagnosis was performed using biopsy (n = 5)

Results:

- **The median time interval between the first diagnosis of primary thyroid cancer and unusual metastases diagnosis was 110 months (11.0–138.0 months). *(9years)***

Quote:

- **although infrequent, distant metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancer is the main cause of mortality in patient and mostly involves the lung, bone and brain.**
- Distant metastasis to other sites in differentiated thyroid cancer patients are rare.
- Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) have indolent clinical course and good prognosis with an approximate 85–90% 10-year survival rate [1–3].
- Distant metastases from DTCs are uncommon but are one of the main causes of cancer-specific mortality in DTC patients [4].
- The 10-year-survival rate is significantly decreased to 10% due to loss of radioiodine avidity of distant metastasis [3, 5].
- Distant metastases of DTC are simultaneously observed in approximately 3–5% of patients at the first diagnosis of DTC, which increases up to 20% when a metachronous occurrence pattern is observed [6–8].
