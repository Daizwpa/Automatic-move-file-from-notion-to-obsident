Objective:

- This research aims to address these challenges by proposing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that accurately classifies skin lesions using both a publicly available ISIC 2019 challenge dataset and a private dataset.

Problematic:

- Traditional methods for skin cancer diagnosis by dermatologists typically follow three main steps: the first is the observation of suspected lesions by the naked eye, followed by dermoscopy, which is an imaging modality that shows more details. Finally, the biopsy step is performed to extract histological characteristics [5].
- The limitation of this process is that it is time-consuming, and the patient may advance to later stages. Furthermore, accurate diagnosis depends on the expertise of the dermatologist, and the availability of skilled dermatologists is limited in public healthcare [6].

Quote:

- The proposed NS-EfficientNet-L2 model effectively classifies skin lesions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, including the winner of the ISIC 2019
challenge for skin lesion classification. This research provides a promising approach for accurately diagnosing skin lesions based on dermoscopic images.
