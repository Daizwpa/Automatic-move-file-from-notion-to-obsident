Objective:

- we developed a machine learning model to deÔ¨Åne a gene signature that could predict lymph-node metastasis (N0 or N1). Kruskal-Wallis tests, univariate and multivariate logistic and Cox regression models, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to correlate the gene signature with clinical outcomes.
