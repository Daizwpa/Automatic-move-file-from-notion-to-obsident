Objective:

- Thyroid cancer (TC) frequently manifests with lung metastases in the pediatric population, occurring at a significant rate of 30 %. This study aims to evaluate the impact of regional patterns of cervical lymph node metastases on lung metastases in pediatric TC.

Conclusion:

- Lateral cervical lymph node metastasis independently predicts the likelihood of lung metastases in pediatric TC. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the importance of thorough examination of the lungs during follow-up, particularly when the number of metastatic lateral cervical lymph nodes exceeds 12.
