Type of paper: Meta-analysis review, systematic review

Objective:

- To evaluate the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes.

Results:

- The pooled sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes were 80% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68–88%) and 85% (95% CI: 63–95%), respectively.
- The sensitivity and false-positive rate (correlation coefficient, 0.655) showed a positive correlation due to a threshold effect, which was responsible for heterogeneity across the studies, as indicated by a Q-test (*p*<0.01) and Higgins I2 statistic (sensitivity, I2=90.11%; specificity, I2=92.49%). In the meta-regression analysis, fat-suppressed imaging, and the analysis method were significant factors influencing the heterogeneity in diagnostic performance.

Conclusion:

- **MRI shows moderate diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with thyroid cancer in the neck. MRI may be an optional or complementary imaging method to ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) in thyroid cancer patients.**

Quote:

- Radiological examinations play an important role in the detection of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with pre- and postoperative thyroid cancer, as their detection is important for reducing tumour recurrence and mortality.1e4
- Cross-sectional imaging techniques are **less operator-dependent** than ultrasound and **offer several other advantages**, including **more precise anatomical information** and **easier** **evaluation of deeply located lesions.**6,8
- The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommended cross-sectional imaging in cases with a clinical suspicion of advanced disease or of vessel or aerodigestive tract invasion, and in cases of inadequate visualisation on neck ultrasound.6,9
- Cross-sectional imaging could be an optional technique for “active surveillance”, which the ATA guidelines suggest for patients who have a high likelihood of recurrence according
to the risk stratiﬁcation.6,9,10
- MRI offers several advantages over CT, such as the absence of ionising radiation, less renal toxicity from contrast agents, and improved soft-tissue contrast. In addition, MRI offers improved anatomical information for the evaluation of the aerodigestive tract,11,12 and MRI
techniques have recently shown rapid advances in image quality and reduced scan times.
