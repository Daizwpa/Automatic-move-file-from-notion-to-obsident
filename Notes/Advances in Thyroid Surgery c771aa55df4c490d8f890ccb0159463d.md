Type of paper: review paper

Objective:

- This is chapter aims to review basic thyroid surgical principles, changes in extent of surgery and discuss new, evolving technology aimed at improving outcomes.

Question:

- 

Conclusion:

- Improved technology in the form of advanced imaging, cytopathology and molecular genetic testing has provided better preoperative information to tailor the appropriate surgical treatment for individual patients.

Quotes:

- In addition to a detailed history (including family history), physical exam and thyroid function testing, ultrasound (US) remains the gold standard of imaging for the workup of thyroid pathology.
- A thorough preoperative evaluation is crucial to an oncologically  successful and safe surgery.
- **However, there are inherent limitations to ultrasonography alone as a preoperative radiographic evaluation including difficulty visualizing deeper structures.**
- Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can improve US evaluation of thyroid carcinoma and cervical lymph nodes.
- CT is also standardized and allows visualization of areas difficult to see on US such as the central neck, upper mediastinum and retropharynx.
