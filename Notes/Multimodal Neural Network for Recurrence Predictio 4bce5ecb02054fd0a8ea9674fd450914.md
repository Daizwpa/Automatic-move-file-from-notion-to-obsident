Method: hybrid multimodal attention model
Status: Done
Task: Recurrence prediction
Type: Journal
Type of paper: Experimental article

Note:

Early prediction of PTC recurrence can prevent the spread of serious carcinoma and reduce the socioeconomic burden on patients.[5]

**According to the risk of structural disease recurrence of the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines**, the histological types of tumor, tumor size, tumor multiplicity, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), extranodal extension (ENE), and mutation of genes (BRAF, TERT) are crucial for estimating PTC recurrence.[10]

Objective:

to develop a deep-learning model **that utilizes not only the initial medical records but also the
thyroid function tests (TFTs) performed periodically post-surgery.**

Task:

- Collect data, that includes 1550 PTC no recurrence patient and 63 PTC recurrence patient.
- Novel multimodal prediction model, called the hybrid architecture for multimodal analysis (HAMA), that can predict PTC recurrence by analyzing numeric and time-series data simultaneously.
- Compare the proposed method with conventional models.
- they simulated real-time predictions at 6-month intervals by reconstructing the data of each patient into real-time data.
