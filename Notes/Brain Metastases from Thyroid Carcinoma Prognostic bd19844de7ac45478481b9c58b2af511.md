Objective:

- we aimed to analyze the characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes of patients with brain metastases (BMs) from thyroid cancer.
- The aim of the present study was to review our center’s experience with the management of BMs from TC over a 30-year period (Hannover Medical School), with our facility being a maximum care referral center. For this purpose, we analyzed patients’ clinical characteristics, the therapeutic approaches used, and corresponding outcomes. Additionally, we evaluated the prognostic factors affecting cancer-specific survival in patients with BMs secondary to TC

Results:

- The results of our study demonstrate increased overall survival in patients younger than 60 years of age at the time of diagnosis of brain metastasis. There was no difference in survival between patients with brain metastasis from papillary carcinoma and those with follicular thyroid carcinoma
- There was no difference between OS in patients with PTC or FTC. However, certain histological subtypes and aggressive variants of PTC, such as the diffuse sclerosing variant, tall cell variant, columnar cell variant, hobnail variant, and solid variant, are associated with a greater likelihood of distant metastases, including to the brain.
- Patients with a single BM were found to have better outcomes than those with multiple metastases.
- The results of our study also demonstrate that OS in patients younger than 60 years of age at the time of diagnosis of BM was significantly better compared to patients older than 60 years of age. Additionally, OS was better in patients with a duration longer than 24 months between TC and BM diagnosis.
- The results of our study are in line with previous studies concerning the coexistence of other organ metastases and BMs [2,32–34]. In our cohort, 90% of patients had metastases involving two or more organs. The most frequent coexisting metastatic sites were the lung (85%) and bone (35%). Furthermore, the results of our study show that BMs develop generally after the onset of other metastases [2,27].

Conclusion:

- In summary, given their rarity, the exact incidence of BMs from TC has been difficult to estimate. Although patients with thyroid cancer generally have a favorable prognosis, those with BMs typically experience a poorer prognosis, characterized by a shorter survival period. In our study, the number of BMs did not play a significant role in determining patient survival. Furthermore, in the case of a longer interval (longer than 24 months) between TC diagnosis and BM manifestation, patients have significantly better OS. Both surgical resection and multidisciplinary adjuvant treatment are critical for patients with BMs from TC.

Quote:

- Although the prognosis of thyroid cancer patients is generally favorable, the prognosis of patients with intracranial metastases from thyroid cancer has been considered unfavorable owing to lower survival rates among such patients compared to those without intracranial involvement.
