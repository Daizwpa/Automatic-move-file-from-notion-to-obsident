A vast range of disorders‚Äîfrom indolent to fast-growing lesions‚Äîare labelled as cancer. Therefore, we believe that several changes should be made to the approach to cancer screening and care, such as use of new terminology for indolent and precancerous disorders.

Therefor: 

- We propose the term indolent lesion of epithelial origin, or IDLE, for those lesions (currently labelled as cancers) and their precursors that are unlikely to cause harm if they are left untreated. Furthermore, precursors of cancer or high-risk disorders should not have the term cancer in them. The rationale for this change in approach is that indolent lesions with low malignant potential are common, and screening brings indolent lesions and their precursors to clinical attention, which leads to overdiagnosis and, if unrecognised, possible overtreatment.

Quotes:

- On March 8‚Äì9, 2012, the National Cancer Institute convened a meeting to assess the problem of cancer overdiagnosis, which occurs when tumours that would otherwise not become symptomatic are identiÔ¨Åed and treated. When this overdiagnosis is not recognised, it can
lead to overtreatment.
- The word cancer encompasses a range of disorders, from those that are always lethal if left untreated (or even if treated) to indolent lesions with extremely low potential for metastatic progression and death.
- Molecular dissection of the genome has clearly shown cancer heterogeneity between and within organ sites and within tumours.2‚Äì8
- Cancer behaviour is strongly aÔ¨Äected by signalling pathways and the microenvironment or organ in which it arises, determining fate, rate of progression, and response to therapeutic interventions.14,15

üí° Strategies to lower chances of indolent disease detection:

- avoidance of diagnostic assessments that are not truly necessary.
- reduction in the frequency of screening examinations.
- screening of the segment of the population that is at highest risk.
- raising of the threshold for recall and biopsy

- A model of cancer progression that is more suited to the current understanding of cancer biology is one of variable progression, depending on: stromal or tumour type.

<aside>
üí° Variables that governs the benefice of screening (Whether screening will be harmful, neutral or helpful):

- Type of cancer ( indolent, aggressive) of cancer.
- Prevalence of cancer in population.
- Availability of effective therapy.
- Ability of early detection to avoid extensive treatment.

> **Cancer behaviours (fate, progression rate, therapeutic response) is strongly affected by:**  signalling pathways and the microenvironment or organ

In this highly variable environment, biology is likely to have more of an eÔ¨Äect on outcome than tumour stage. For example, a small tumour can have a high metastatic potential, whereas a large tumour can have low metastatic potential.

- Indolent disease might account for 15‚Äì75% of all cancers, depending on organ type.
- Disease- based screening and diagnostic scans for various purposes have contributed to cancer overdiagnosis, which leads to overtreatment when not recognised, thus reducing the overall eÔ¨Äectiveness of screening. 9
