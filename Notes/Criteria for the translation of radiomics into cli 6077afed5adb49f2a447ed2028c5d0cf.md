- Similar to CAD, radiomics can assist with clinical decision-making. Radiomic features, namely measurements extracted from medical images (currently usually CT, MRI or digital radiography), are combined with data on clinical characteristics and from other omics analyses to detect disease, predict the likelihood of death, disease progression and/or recurrence by a specific time point, evaluate response to therapy or identify an appropriate course of treatment.
- The ultimate goal of radiomic analyses should be the development of a test, defined by the FDAâ€“NIH Biomarker Working Group as a system comprising materials for measurement, procedures for measurement, and methods or criteria for interpretation5, that can be used to guide medical decision-making as in disease diagnosis and management.
- Across all medical indications, 343 artificial intelligence and machine learning-based tests currently have FDA clearance, only a small proportion of which are based on radiomics6
