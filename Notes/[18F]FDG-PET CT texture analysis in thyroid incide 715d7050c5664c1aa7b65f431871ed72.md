Objective:

- We aimed to evaluate the ability of [18F]FDG-PET/CT texture analysis to predict final diagnosis in thyroid incidentaloma.

Task:

- Collect [18F]FDG-PET/CT  image.
- segmented using a General Electric AW workstation running PET VCAR software.
- LifeX software ([http://www.lifexsoft.org](http://www.lifexsoft.org/)) was used to perform texture analysis.
- Statistical analysis was performed with R package

Hypothesis:

- Thyroid incidentaloma was defined as focal thyroid uptake (i.e., increased [18F]FDG uptake compared to surrounding or contralateral thyroid parenchyma) identified on [18F]FDG-PET/CT study incidentally and was described as unilateral (i.e., occurred in less than one lobe) and bilateral (i.e., involving both thyroid lobes) according to the thyroid uptake pattern.

Conclusion:

- [18F]FDG-PET/CT texture analysis seems to be a promising approach to stratify the patients with thyroid incidentaloma identified on PET scans, with respect to the risk of the diagnosis of a malignant thyroid nodule and thus, could refine the selection of the patients to be referred for cytology.

Quotes:

- Incidentalomas are findings on an imaging test performed for other reasons, for which there are no matching symptoms in the patient.
- Published reports estimated the prevalence of thyroid incidentalomas on [18F]FDG-PET images between 1.2% and 4.3%. These data are in line with a recent meta-analysis which reported a prevalence of thyroid incidentalomas of 1.8%.
- the chance of malignancy among incidentalomas detected by [18F]FDG is higher than incidental nodules discovered with other imaging modalities, with a chance for malignancy ranging from 14 to 59%.
- Many researchers postulated that malignant lesions tend to show higher [18F]FDG uptake (i.e., SUVmax) than that of benign lesions (Soelberg et al. 2012).
