Quote:

- Radiomics is an emerging area in quantitative image analysis that aims to relate large-scale extracted imaging information to clinical and biological endpoints. The development of quantitative imaging methods along with machine learning has enabled the opportunity to move data science research towards translation for more personalized cancer treatments.
- In recent years, deep learning architectures have demonstrated their tremendous potential for image segmentation, reconstruction, recognition, and classification. Many powerful open-source and commercial platforms are currently available to embark in new research areas of radiomics.
- Radiomics is an emerging area in quantitative image analysis that aims to relate large-scale data mining of images to clinical and biological endpoints.1 The fundamental idea is that medical images are much richer in information than what the human eye can discern.
- **Tumor biopsy-based assays provide limited tumor characterization as the extracted sample may not always represent the heterogeneity of the whole patient’s tumor, while radiomics can comprehensively assess the three- dimensional (3D) tumor landscape by means of extracting relevant imaging information.3**
- The term radiomics originated from other — omics sciences (e.g., genomics and proteomics) and conveys the clear intent to invoke personalized medicine based on medical images. It traces its roots to computer-aided detection/ diagnosis (CAD) of medical images.6,7
