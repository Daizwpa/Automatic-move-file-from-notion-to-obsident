Type of paper: Meta-analysis review

Objective:

- To evaluate the performance of preoperative ultrasound in the diagnosis of cervical lymph nodes metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer and its value in assisting cervical lymph node dissection.

Results:

- The pooled The pooled sensitivity, speciﬁcity, DOR and area under curve (AUC) of ultrasound in detecting central CLNM were 0.33 (95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI): 0.31–0.35), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92–0.94), 5.63 (95% CI: 3.50–9.04), and 0.69, respectively;
- lateral CLNM were 0.70 (95% CI: 0.68–0.72), 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82–0.85), 18.7 (95% CI: 10.3–33.9)
and 0.88, respectively.

Conclusion:

- Preoperative ultrasound  demonstrates poor sensitivity in the diagnosis of central CLNM
- Preoperative ultrasound demonstrates good diagnostic efficacy for lateral CLNM of PTC.
- Prophylactic central CLND is recommended to PTC patients due to the high incidence of central CLNM and low diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound.
- we found that the pooled sensitivity, speciﬁcity and AUC of ultrasound were 0.33, 0.93, and 0.69, respectively, suggesting that ultrasound has high false negative rate, and poor diagnostic accuracy in assessing central CLNM of PTC.
- the pooled sensitivity, speciﬁcity and AUC of ultrasound for lateral CLNM were 0.70, 0.84 and 0.88, respectively, indicating its good diagnostic eﬃcacy.
- The poorer diagnostic  accuracy of ultrasound for central CLNM might stem from the anatomical complexity of the thoracic inlet and the low accuracy of the imaging characteristics for nodal malignancy.
- **Considering the high rate of central CLNM and the poor diagnostic eﬃcacy of ultrasound, prophylactic central CLND should be recommended to all PTCs.**
- ultrasound showed poor performance in identifying central CLNM. Other imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were not superior to ultrasound in the assessment of central CLNM of PTC [13,23,33–35].
- Prophylactic central CLND should be performed on patients with PTC due to the high incidence of central CLNM and the poor performance of preoperative imaging.
- The application of ultrasound and /or combined with FNA cytology/ molecular testing/ Tg assay can facilitate the determination of lateral CLNM of PTC preoperatively.

Quotes:

- Previous studies reported that the rate of central CLNM of PTC patients staged as cN0 was 15.9%–53%. In the present study, the pooled rate of central CLNM of PTC was 48.0%, suggesting the high incidence of central CLNM of PTC.
- almost 50% of PTC patients suffer from central CLNM
- Recently, a meta-analysis showed that patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and prophylactic central CLNM had a signiﬁcantly reduced risk of locoregional recurrence (risk ratio=0.66, P= 0.008)
- Lundgren et al found that patients with CLNM experienced a higher mortality in diﬀerentiated thyroid cancer, and incomplete surgical excision was associated higher mortality, particularly in patients with stage I disease [39].
- Previous studies found that the CT and FDG-PET/CT did not provide additional beneﬁt over ultrasound in the diagnosis of lateral CLNM of PTC [23,24,28,33], which was also not routinely recommended by ATA [7].
- ultrasound should be routinely performed on the lateral neck
of patients with thyroid nodules, which can provide good diagnostic
information in assessing CLNM status. Furthermore, ultrasound-guided ﬁne-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, molecular mutation testing (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC, and PAX8/PPARγ) and FNA thyroglobulin assay (FNA-Tg) toward suspicious lymph nodes can facilitate the determination of metastatic nodal diseases [41–43].
