- The estimated proportion of thyroid cancer cases in women attributable
to overdiagnosis between 2008 and 2012 was approximately:
    - 93% in South Korea,
    - 91% in Belarus,
    - 87% in China,
    - 84% in Italy and Croatia,
    - 83% in Slovakia and France

- According to our estimations, over 830 000 women might have been overdiagnosed between 2008 and 2012 in the 26 countries analysed, including approximately 390 000 women in China, 140 000 women in South Korea, 120 000 women in the USA, 31 000 women in Italy, and 25 000 women in France.
- Overall, more than 220 000 men might have been overdiagnosed with thyroid cancer
between 2008 and 2012 in the 26 study countries (appendix p 9).
