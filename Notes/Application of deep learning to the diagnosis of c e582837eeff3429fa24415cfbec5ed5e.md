Objective:

- To develop a deep learning–based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for use in the CT diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with thyroid cancer.

Problematic:

- Preoperative staging of LNM.
- Surgery extent.
- Prophylactic lateral neck dissection may increase the chance of removing such tumors, it increases the
risk of surgical complications and decreases the quality of life after surgery [3, 10].
- 

Task:

- A total of 995 axial CT images that included benign (n = 647) and malignant (n = 348) lymph nodes were collected from 202 patients with thyroid cancer who underwent CT for surgical planning between July 2017 and January 2018.
- The datasets were randomly split into training (79.0%), validation (10.5%), and test (10.5%) datasets.
- Eight deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were used to classify the images into metastatic or benign lymph nodes. including,  VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and ResNet. The models were Pretrained  on the ImageNet.
- Evaluate performing algorithm and selection best one which is
- Class-specific discriminative regions were visualized with attention heatmap using a global average pooling method.

Results:

- The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for the tested algorithms ranged from 0.909 to 0.953. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the best-performing algorithm were all 90.4%, respectively. Attention heatmap highlighted important subregions for further clinical review.

Quote:

- Because of this *(model for predict lymph node metastasis )*, accurate preoperative staging has become a major issue for surgical planning [2, 3].

- Although differentiated thyroid cancers have a good prognosis and low mortality rate, cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) has been reported in up to 60–70% of patients and is considered an important risk factor for locoregional recurrence [4–8].

- Although prophylactic lateral neck dissection may increase the chance of removing such tumors, it increases the risk of surgical complications and decreases the quality of life after surgery [3,10].

- Therefore, the extent of lymph node dissection required should be more accurately determined before the initial surgery.

- Deep learning techniques have recently been introduced in medical imaging for accurate and consistent interpretation of imaging features [13–15].

- CT is a standardized and objective imaging technique that is less operator-dependent than other modalities, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that CT achieved a
summary sensitivity of 62% (95% confidence interval (CI), 52–70%) and specificity of 87% (95% CI, 80–92%) in patients with thyroid cancers [11].

- interpretability is increased through the attention heatmap generated by CAM. It is generally difficult to explain the internal relationship between input data and the label predicted by the model. However, using the attention heatmap, we can infer which part of the input image is focused on by the model.
- the CAD system has scalability. The performance of the CAD system could be upgraded to incorporate reports on incorrect results.
