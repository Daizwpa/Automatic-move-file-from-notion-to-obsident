Task: Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis, Review
Type of paper: Meta-analysis review, systematic review

Objective:

- We aimed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of CT and MRI in detecting cervical lymph node metastasis, and to establish unified diagnostic criteria via systematic review and meta-analysis.

Method:

Results:

Conclusion:

- Our meta-analyses suggested that CT had a higher SEN than MRI when node was used as unit of analysis; MRI had a higher SPE when neck level was used as unit of analysis; and MRI had a higher AUC when patient was used as unit of analysis.
