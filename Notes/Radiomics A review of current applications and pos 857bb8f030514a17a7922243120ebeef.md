Objective:

- With the recent success in the application of immunotherapy for treating various advanced cancers, the tumor microenvironment has rapidly become an important ﬁeld of research. The tumor microenvironment is complex and its characteristics strongly inﬂuence disease biology and potentially responses to systemic
therapy. Accurate preoperative assessment of tumor microenvironment is of great signiﬁcance for the formulation of an immunotherapy strategy and evaluation of patient prognosis. As a research hotspot in medical image analysis technology, radiomics has been applied in the auxiliary diagnosis of the tumor microenvironment. **This article reviews the current status of radiomics in the elective application on tumor microenvironment and discusses potential prospects.**

Problems and challenges:

Despite the promise of radiomics in studying the TME, there are still many obstacles that limit its application in clinical practice.

- The establishment of a radiomics model requires pre-planned manual segmentation of images. Manual segmentation is complex, time-consuming, and subjective, which affects modeling efﬁciency and objectivity, whereas automatic segmentation can improve speed and accuracy [102].
- Most radiomic features are difﬁcult or impossible to explain
biologically, so when they turn out to be signiﬁcant in a model, it
remains unclear whether they represent biological phenomena, are
related to imaging technique, or are simply confounders.
- Radiomics can be affected by many factors, such as different scanning equipment, tumor segmentation procedures, and acquisition protocols. Therefore, it is necessary to establish consistent protocols to avoid variability in data collection.
- Many radiomic models likely overﬁt their training data simply based on the difference between training data set size and number of available features. As a result, models have not been shown to generalize well to other data sets.

Conclusion:

- In conclusion, accurate imaging has become the norm of medical
imaging, and the development of radiomics has provided new ideas
for a noninvasive evaluation of TME,
- Currently, studies suggest that radiomics has a potential for the assessment of TME, and breakthroughs in future research can be anticipated.
- In future research, the combination of radiomics and deep learning will certainly promote the progression of TME research.

Quote:

- Early research on tumors focused on the tumor alone; however, with the evolution of cancer research, the focus gradually shifted to the surrounding tissue environment, namely the tumor microenvironment (TME).
- The TME is a highly dynamic and heterogeneous assemblage of immune cells, ﬁbroblasts, precursor cells, endothelial cells, signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix components (Table 1; Fig. 1) [3].
- the interaction between its various components within the TME jointly regulates regional immune effects and ultimately determines disease outcomes [4,5]. There is evidence that the TME is an important part of antitumor immunity, making it a potential new target for tumor immunotherapy. For instance, some work has been
done in cholangiocarcinoma to evaluate the role of ﬁbroblasts/TME
in resistance to targeted therapies [6].
- In recent years, immunotherapy has been widely used in cancer
treatment and is considered an important antitumor weapon. Cur-
rent cancer immunotherapies are clinically effective against a variety
of cancers, including melanoma, lymphoma, head and neck cancer,
clear cell kidney cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer [7,8].
- **Immunotherapy has signiﬁcantly changed cancer treatment strategies.** Understanding the interactions and immune escape mechanisms of various components of **the TME is key to further improve current immunotherapies or develop new therapeutic approaches [9].** Currently, **TME detection methods rely on biopsy or surgical resection.** However, these methods are invasive and can be intolerable for patients with complicated medical conditions. Therefore, there is an urgent need for methods that can help assess noninvasively and comprehensively TME.
- Medical imaging can non-invasively provide information on tumor morphology. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography, in which an antibody that
targets a cell-surface marker speciﬁc for a cell type is radiolabeled
with a PET isotope and used to track the dynamics of the targeted
cells, are currently seen as the most promising tools for revealing
tumors events in response to treatment [10,11].
- As an emerging analysis method, radiomics can extract high-throughput quantitative features from medical images to describe
- These resources can inform the development of diagnostic, predictive, or prognostic radiomic models to support clinical decision-making strategies and improve individualized treatment
selection [18]. Presently, radiomic research on the TME is increasing,
and the correlation between radiomic features and TME components has been gradually conﬁrmed. The performance and potential clinical utility of radiomic models developed using innovative techniques such as machine learning may be critical for the continued progress and clinical implementation of radiomics in TME prediction.
- Preoperative noninvasive methods based on radiomics can help
assess TME, **which will improve the patient’s diagnosis, treatment, and overall quality of life.**
