Quote:

- Cancer growth is frequently associated with an expansion of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) within and surrounding the primary tumor (histologically most frequently detected with the D2-40 anti-podoplanin antibody) and with lymphangiogenesis in tumor-draining lymph nodes.
- A large number of experimental and clinical studies have clearly demonstrated that **the density of tumor-associated lymphatic vessels**, **the detection of lymphatic invasion by tumor cells**, and **intratumoral expression of the main lymphangiogenic growth factor VEGF-C** all correlate with lymph node metastasis and poor patient outcome in many cancer types
- Although lymphatic vessels directly contribute to lymph node metastasis,

- The vascular system is composed of two types of vessels that form the blood and lymphatic vasculature, respectively.
- blood vessels are fundamental for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients
- lymphatics are essential for **lipid absorption from the gut**, reverse cholesterol transport removing peripheral tissue cholesterol, maintenance of tissue fluid homeostasis, and immune surveillance.
