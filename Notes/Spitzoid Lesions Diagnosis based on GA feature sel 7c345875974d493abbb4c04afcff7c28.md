Objective:

- This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence model to support the diagnosis of spitzoid lesions.

Methodology :

The proposed system has three stages:

1-  SMOTE method applied to solve the imbalanced data problem.

2- Use genetic algorithm to select significant features and eliminate irrelevant features

3- Employee Random forest classifier to make decision for two different categories of lesions (Spitz nevus or Atypical Spitz Tumors).
