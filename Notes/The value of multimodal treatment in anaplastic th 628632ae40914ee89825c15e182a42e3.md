Objective:

- Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis, particularly in patients presenting with distant metastasis (DM). This study aimed to assess the effect of combination treatment strategies on survival in ATC patients with DM.

Results:

- Of the 315 ATC patients with DM included in the study, surgery to the primary tumor, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and lung metastasis were identified as independent risk factors for survival. Patients who received primary tumor surgery plus chemotherapy or surgery plus chemoradiation exhibited a superior outcome compared to those who received only one treatment modality.

Conclusion:

- Our findings suggest that a combination treatment approach, particularly surgery combined with radiotherapy or surgery combined with chemoradiotherapy, may provide the most optimal treatment option for ATC patients with DM. These results may provide some evidence for clinical decision making, but larger sample cohorts are still needed for validation.
