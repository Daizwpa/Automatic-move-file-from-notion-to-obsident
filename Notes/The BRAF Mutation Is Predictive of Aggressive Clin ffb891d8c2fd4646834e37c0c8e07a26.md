Objective:

- This study analyzed the utility of BRAF mutation screening of ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens for predicting aggressive clinicopathological characteristics of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).

Task:

- Collect FNAB specimens from 61 with clinicopathological features.
- Assess The T1799A BRAF mutation status in FNAB specimen.
- Examine the relation association between BRAF status with clinicopathological features.

Results:

- the BRAF mutation was statistically significantly associated with multifocality, extrathyroidal invasion, lateral LNM, and advanced tumor stages III and IV.
- The BRAF mutation, pathologic features (central LNM), and US features (upper pole location) were independent predictive factors for lateral LNM in a multivariate analysis with odds ratios of 18.144 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.999–164.664; P = 0.01), 8.582 (95% CI, 1.014–76.662; P = 0.049) and 9.576 (95% CI, 1.374–66.728; P = 0.023), respectively.
- We observed that in 19 (95%) of 20 cases, the BRAF status of the resected PTC and the preoperative FNAB specimens were identical.
- The ability to establish BRAF status from FNAB demonstrates that this method can be used for preoperative evaluations of thyroid nodules. Recent studies have demonstrated statistically significant associations between the BRAF mutation and extrathyroidal extension, LNM, and high TNM stages.15–18.

Conclusion:

- BRAF mutation-positive PTMCs were more likely to manifest aggressive characteristics (extrathyroidal extension and LNM).
- The BRAF mutation screening of FNAB specimens can be used to predict aggressive clinicopathological characteristics of PTMC
- Lateral neck nodes should be meticulously analyzed for cases of PTMC demonstrating the following three characteristics: BRAF mutation, central LNM, and US features in the upper pole location.
- we demonstrate that testing for the BRAF mutation in FNAB specimens from PTMC patients can be used to predict poorer clinicopathologic outcomes preoperatively.

Quotes:

- BRAF mutational status can be reliably established from cells aspirated from a thyroid nodule.33–36.
- BRAF mutation related molecular derangements, including overexpression of tumor-promoting genes, silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, and aberrant down-regulation of thyroid iodide handling genes, indicate that radioiodine treatment will be less affective in treating PTCs. 9,10
- The incidence of lateral LNM in PTMC patients ranges from 3.1% to 18.2%.37–39
- Some reports demonstrated that patients with nodal metastasis have an increased rate of local recurrence, which can influence patient survival.40–42  Therefore, appropriate lymph node dissection can be crucial to reduce the recurrence risk.
