Sodium levothyroxine :is one of the most used treatments, it is a synthetic thyroid hormone used in the treatment of thyroid disorders and diseases.

Objective:

This work, differently, aims to predict the LT4 (Sodium levothyroxine) treatment trend for patients suffering from hypothyroidism.

Task:

A dedicated dataset was built that includes medical information related to patients being treated in “ AOU Federico 3” hospital of Naples.

build machine learning models

compare them.
