Objective:

- This review delves into the fundamental modulators of thyroid cancers,
encompassing genetic, epigenetic, and non-coding RNA factors while exploring their intricate interplay and influence. Epigenetic modifications directly affect the expression of causal genes, while long non-coding RNAs impact the function and expression of micro-RNAs, culminating in tumorigenesis.
- Additionally, this article provides a concise overview of the advantages and disadvantages associated with pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions in thyroid cancer. Furthermore, with technological advancements, integrating modern software and computing into healthcare and medical practices has become increasingly prevalent.

Note:

- While both men and women are affected by thyroid cancer, it disproportionately affects women across the globe.
- Thyroid cancer is divided into four categories: papillary thyroid: cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, and anaplastic thyroid cancer.
- Differentiated thyroid cancer, including Papillary and follicular cancers are the most frequent types, representing more than 90 % of all diagnoses [2].
- Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most prevalent form of thyroid cancer and represents about 80 % of all cases.
- Genetic alterations play a critical role in the development and progression of thyroid cancer, with specific mutations in genes such as BRAF, RAS, and RET identified as key drivers in different subtypes of thyroid carcinoma [7].
- These genetic alterations not only contribute to the initiation and growth of thyroid tumors but also influence treatment response and prognosis [8].
- AI and ML algorithms have **shown promise in predicting treatment outcomes, analyzing complex datasets, and developing personalized approaches to thera­peutics [17]**. **In the context of thyroid cancer, modern machine learning and deep learning technologies are being employed to analyze factors such as ultrasonography results and biopsy samples, aiding in diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment decision-making.**
- There are different types of thyroid cancer, some of which are more aggressive than others, and while most grow slowly, some can progress quickly. Nevertheless, most cases of thyroid cancer can be cured with treatment. Various factors contribute to the risk of thyroid cancer, including exposure to ionizing radiation, a family history of the disease, certain genetic syndromes, and benign thyroid conditions like nodular goiter or thyroid adenoma [19].’
- **Standard treatment methods for differentiated thyroid cancer, such as thyroidectomy followed by radi­oiodine therapy, have proven to be relatively effective [3]. However, rare variants of thyroid carcinoma, such as anaplastic thyroid carci­noma, present significant challenges due to their aggressive nature and limited treatment options [4].**
- Therapeutic interventions in thyroid cancer encompass both pharmacological and non-
pharmacological approaches [14]:
    - Pharmacological interventions include targeted therapies, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.
    - non-pharmacological interventions consist of surgery, radiotherapy, and
    radioiodine therapy [15].

2.1 Papillary thyroid  cancer:

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most prevalent form of thyroid
cancer and represents about 80 % of all cases. It is distinguished by
papillary structures and nuclear characteristics like nuclear grooves,
nuclear pseudo inclusions, and nuclear clearing [20]. Generally, it is a
slow-growing condition with an outstanding 5-year survival rate of over 95 %. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with PTC than men, with a female-male ratio of 3:1. In recent years, the occurrence of PTC has been on the rise, especially in countries with sufficient iodine, such as the US, Canada, and Japan [21,22].

2.2. Follicular thyroid cancer:

Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is a form of thyroid cancer that
originates from the follicular cells in the thyroid gland. Although it is
less common than PTC, FTC represents around 10–15 % of all thyroid
cancers. Its growth is usually slow and has a positive prognosis, however the probability of distant metastasis is higher than that of PTC. The incidence of FTC is higher among women than men, with a ratio of approximately 2:1. The rate of FTC is lower than that of PTC and has been comparatively consistent over the past few decades. [23].

2.3. Medullary thyroid cancer:

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare form of thyroid cancer which begins in the C cells of the thyroid gland and makes up 5–10 % of all thyroid cancer cases. This type of cancer is dissimilar from other thyroid cancers as it does not come from follicular cells and is not affected by radioactive iodine. [24,25]. Sporadic MTC is more common, making up about 75 % of all cases, and the rate of occurrence is low -approximately 2–3 cases every million people each year [26].

2.4. Anaplastic thyroid cancer:

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an uncommon, yet very invasive
type of thyroid cancer accounting for lower than 2 % of all thyroid
cancer cases. It is also referred to as undifferentiated thyroid cancer due to its lack of separation and the absence of particular thyroid markers [27,28]. It usually shows up as a quickly expanding lump in the neck, accompanied by pain, difficulty in swallowing, and hoarseness. This cancer is rare, comprising of 1–2 % of all thyroid cancers. It is more frequent in the elderly, with a median age at detection of about 65 years.
